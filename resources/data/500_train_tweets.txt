564	#treat is awesome, but #trick is more fun.
564	You can learn a lot about how people see you by how you're listed. For example, it seems that people feel strongly that I work at Twitter.
564	I'm not sure when I switched from reading books in bed just before going to sleep to checking email, but I don't think it's healthy.
564	Another headphones cable on the fritz. I need to buy these things in bulk.
564	@handle Get a magical parking card. http://bit.ly/zpKsH Available pre-tax through WageWorks.
564	Ok then. I'm just going to hold off for a little while and react to this later.
564	I'm beginning to think this day would have gone better if I had started it differently. Mainly if I'd skipped the getting out of bed part.
564	I just finished season one of The Tudors, and omg you guys--you'll never believe how it ends!
564	@handle Perhaps ideal for the undead.
564	It's a good thing I have this never-ending mountain of email to sort though. Otherwise waiting on these tests would be boh-rring.
564	I want there to be substantially less waiting in my day to day life.
564	Embroidery: cooler than you would think.
564	@handle called me a pretty little hate machine. It made me blush.
564	Don't cloud the wonder of this week with your little ...facts.
564	I block for misdirected @ replies.
564	@handle No. I would burn alive contentedly at my laptop without ever having heard the fire alarm.
564	Finally figured it out. There's only one escalator at this Bart station. It changes direction depending on the time of day.
564	I'm watching the shipping casualty of this move hasten to its doom from the tracking page. Poor little guy. He has no idea what he's in for.
564	@handle Wow. Just... wow.
564	Took a chance on some molasses clove cookies. Oh yeaaah, I live on the wild side. And it's tasty here.
564	@handle What timezone are you in? Because if being up at 11pm makes you an insomniac then... *pats your head*
564	@handle Yes, and then she loaned it to me. But I can assure you, we both knew what we were getting into.
564	Anyone who believes that you cannot judge a book by its cover has not seen the cover of this book: http://amzn.com/0373621353
564	The prospect of a new office on Monday fills me with the kind of hope that scares me. (That is, any.)
564	Just remembered my stressful dream. I sure hope @handle isn't mad at me still.
564	@handle Well, hello fellow moocher. Thanks for getting to it so quickly!
564	Today in cute: Cinder eats with his hands. Scoops up each piece of kibble with his paw and head tilted, daintily dishes it into his mouth.
564	Nothing will make you realize just how dumb something is as trying to explain it to someone else.
564	The one thing that USPS has on UPS, FedEx and all other carriers: the forwarding address.
564	We sincerely appreciate your feedback. But please note, there is a 250 character limit. Max exceeded. Turns out I only needed four.
564	I'm going to be a full hour late to this thing. My only excuse? C'mon, it's Saturday.
564	Donated to a public artistic preformance for the first time in years. It was both striking and silent.
564	Thinking warm, congratulatory thoughts towards the people who made that thing happen. You know who you are.
564	@handle Never Forget.
564	Abandoned cat is abandoned. http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/pet/1451640811.html Please adopt or RT.
564	Alright, that's it. Today calls for cookies.
564	I need something to cheer me up from my somber contemplation. Oh, this economics book will do quite nicely. What? Dismal is realtive.
564	Wanted: a lightweight, fast, simple note taking web app that stores to the cloud and is on iphone. Note: omnifocus does not qualify AT ALL.
564	@handle That is exactly as it should be.
564	Whatever. It'll be like paypal. We'll just hire lots of laywers.
564	What ever happened to smelling salts anyway? Oh. Ammonia gas is toxic in large concentrations for prolonged periods, and can be fatal...
564	GENIUS money making idea: An alarm clock that involves smelling salts.
564	Alright you guys, I let you have your fun. But it's November--it's time to put the sun away now.
564	@handle I don't get the hate people have for Nickelback. Sure, they're poppy and derivative--but since when does that inspire such rage?
564	@handle Critical mass represents almost, but not quite everything that I hate about San Francisco.
564	@handle I get that all the time. I block the misguided souls so they no longer appear in my timeline. (Their updates, not their souls.)
3039	@handle Not a cool joke! I got pretty pissed for a split second! :)
3039	WOW! This morning has been a roller coaster! But I'm in such a great mood :D

3039	:D! @handle RT @handle: @handle wow, uli is the luckiest man on earth. :)
3039	@handle You know, punching bags do punch back :) Hope your day gets better.
3039	@handle Some things just aren't meant to mix... and other are :D Like football and sex :D
3039	@handle It's got everything you need: football and sex :D
3039	@handle Thanks! :D If you need an extra body at your practices, let me know :) Just throwing it out there ;)
3039	@handle Hahaha! Thanks! Def look into it. It's tough, not your typical girlie league.
3039	@handle Couldn't make it, but I tried out last year and want to try out again. :)
3039	@handle Not at all :) I'm all for it!
3039	@handle That's interesting! It's all about relevance.
3039	@handle That would not be fun at all! Do you not like it?
3039	@handle Hell yea! I'm all pumped up now and want to go play!
3039	@handle What what?
3039	@handle Ohhhh. How'd it go? What did you discuss?
3039	A quick convo about the Lingerie Football League and I want to go hit a tackling dummy! Grrrrr!

3039	@handle I'm glad you didn't try to find out for yourself :)
3039	@handle Which lyric? My fave of his is I'm not a businessman. I'm a business, man. :D
3039	Someone just told me it's Wednesday. I almost slapped them! Don't mess w/ my days of the week! My dad and bro come in tomorrow!

3887	With brand experience must understand not only what we need to start doing but also what we should stop doing #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	A well defined & executed brand strategy will yield quantifiable results - volume, mkt leverage.... #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	ROI? Brand performance is about growth in revenue, profit, mkt share, loyalty. #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Best brand portrayals are emotional & focus on benefits, not features per Joel English. #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Brand building is a journey and requires a long term committment and a well defined process to drive success. #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Brand Mastery: Want engaged consumers? Understand that a brand is not a campaign; brand is who we are and what we do #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Brand Mastery: Is your brand value proposition hard-wired into the culture of the organization? Powerful brands do this. #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Must have a brand-driven culture that transforms an org into one that delivers on the brand rather than just promotes. #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Brand Mastery: Have to be aware of brand barriers in crafting strategy. Your brand has to be relevant and believable. #shsmd #hcmktg

3887	Brand Mastery session: Rob Klien - @handle - good mkt research reduces the risk in decision making #shsmd

8129	In contrast to this lilting sound, its substance was denser, like a blind child giving you explicit directions in darkness.
2771	Uhoh - Steve McNanaman sighting!!!
2771	@handle - me too. That was real emotion from AI.
2771	@handle - Instead of handing other packages, perhaps the lady @ the FedEx counter would like to handle your package. Just a thought...
2771	Watching the World Cup draw. Curious to see who's in the Group Of Death.
2771	@handle - South Africa is a sleeper pick. Steven Pienaar is quality and their GK, Itumeleng Khune is real good. Watch for them.
2771	Listening to DeBarge's Greatest Hits. Not El DeBarge -- just Debarge....the whole crew. Serious tunes !
2771	New tunes tonight in DC!!!
2771	@handle - Timbaland knows what he's doing. 1000%.
2771	@handle - on the site now. that tune with Nelly Furtado is HEAVY!
2771	@handle - good point on the $$ thing.
2771	@handle - worse than Whole Foods?
2771	AI press conference, very emotional. #3 belongs in Philly. The AI story will end the way it should.
2771	@handle - finally. a journalist with common sense.
2771	Wookie - Battle. Never gets old. EVER. -> http://bit.ly/XUgwe
2771	@handle - congrats on the new gig! You've got something important to say and radio is the way to do it.
2771	RT @handle: RT @handle: Latest Dub War Podcast is up mixed by Badawi: http://bit.ly/5xb5yw
2771	@handle - Ian Eagle is good, but he's no Gus Johnson...
2771	@handle - you know it bro. this is Baltimore. Life imitating art and vice versa. \
2771	Eto'o is top class, but Ibrahimovic is next level. He has World Footballer Of The Year talent. I don't see the same in Eto'o.
2771	@handle - looking forward to the read. thanks...
2771	@handle - can you link us to the column please?
2771	@handle - barca 1 - xerez 0. three more to go...
2771	@handle - true. that's a lot of talent on the bench. I don't have 1/2time Hennessey. Just Gatorade.
2771	@handle - yeah, those are pink grapefruit kits. not sexy at all. Hi-Liter pink.
2771	@handle - i was thinking tangerine....but grapefruit works.
2771	Barca v Xerez on ESPN2 right now. Barca should win this match by 4 goals. Xerez is bottom of the table in LaLiga. Barca is # 1. We'll see.
2771	@handle - I finally finished the book. An enjoyable and educational read. The epilogue...amazing. THANK YOU.
2771	@handle - likewise! We're both operating from what we know. Curious to get your take on this.
2771	@handle - The break in Lyn Collins - Think, Baltimore club staple. That break was used in dnb, but not nearly as much in bmore club.
2771	@handle - The answer, bmore. I don't know much about dnb, but i do know The Winstons - 'Amen Brother' is the backbone for dnb & jungle.
2771	@handle - (For those that are wondering) Lyn Collins - Think: -> http://bit.ly/6eiICa
2771	@handle - well done.
2771	Sylvia Striplin - You Can't Turn Me Away. Give it a listen...you know the sample. http://bit.ly/6q5IJt

1121	RT @handle: No disrespect to @handle, but I'm Sounders Till I Die! Vote @handle in TPL: http://ow.ly/v7V4 #TPL
1121	The stars were aligned last night for Seattle. Today, not so much for the Seahawks. We should find a way to remedy this...
1121	So what does everyone think??? Who is going to get the game winner tonight in the Sounders Kansas City game??? I'll take Jaqua...
1121	Why does it bother me so much in emails when people use to/two/too incorrectly? Does that make me a huge nerd? If so, I am ok with it....
1121	Weeding and fertilizing my lawn before the US match. I should hire a rookie to do this...
1121	Speedy recovery to Charlie... can't wait to see your 9th min tribute. And good luck to the US Men...
1121	This is what injured players do when the team is away... http://bit.ly/13LJwt
1121	Back to training after the weekend off. Got to train almost all-in for the first time in 6 weeks. So fun. Still excited about the US Nats!
1121	VOTE FOR ME: http://ow.ly/tWap RT @handle: Twitterverse Players League - Group H: @handle @handle @handle @handle #TPL
1121	Weekend off for the team. Allows us to focus on the Honduras match tomorrow. I can already smell South Africa (in a good way)...
1121	Hosted 'Cribs' at the Starfire facilities today. Keep your eye out for it online. Wait till you see what I planted in a couple lockers!

1121	Yoga and physical therapy this morning.. All you can eat sushi lunch with Roger, now brainstorming for a roaring 20's outfit. Suggestions?
1121	I think tetherball is one of the more underrated sports. Should it only be played during 4th grade recess??? I think not...
1121	Roger, aka the homeless man from Seattle, shines as the hero! So happy for the boys. A la Black Eyed Peas, tonight's gonna be a good night!
1121	Team away to Columbus, injured guys holding down the fort here in Seattle. Despite my effort, the stationary bike will not move....

1121	Visited Puesta del Sol School today in Factoria and spoke to the 2nd and 5th grades. Spanish Language Schools are pretty amazing!!!
1121	Tough weekend for Seattle Sports... Sounders, Seahawks! At least Stanford got a victory over UW... sorry Huskies.
1121	Two things I hate about yesterday's game. Losing, and seeing players get injured. I hope Ralston's knee is not that bad.
1121	TGIF... one more day till another big game. Might as well be in the playoffs already.

9148	@handle -- To answer your D/ST question, you really can't lose with either NO or BALT ... both are playing HORRIBLE TEAMS (go w/ Ravens)
9148	@handle -- Titans rookie WR Kenny Britt may be a great Gage replacement -- and a better alternative to T.O. at this point ...
9148	@handle -- No worries. Those 3 rants were not intended for anyone in particular ... I just hate defensive questions, in general ...
9148	@handle -- I would not drop Donald Brown for ANY Redskin right now ... unless you REALLY A NEED a 4th-string WR, hold on to D-Brown
9148	Here are today's Thursday Revelations/Fantasy Clicks ... enjoy! http://tinyurl.com/yj4cqwe
9148	@handle -- Change of plans: Justin Gage has multiple broken bones in his back ... you might wanna NOT pick him up for the time being ...
9148	@handle -- Then go Brady over Peyton ...
9148	@handle -- I'd rank your WRs 1)Austin 2)Jennings 3)Holmes 4)Boldin for Week 10 ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Do you actually have Peyton AND Brady? If so, does it really matter?
9148	@handle -- Celek over V-Davis (barely) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd rather have LT/Crabtree over D-Jax, if that's what you're asking ... (but it's very, very close)
9148	@handle -- If you REALLY want AP, you'll have to surrender 1 Tier 1 RB/1 Tier 1 WR/1 Tier 2 RB/WR ... it's got to be a 3-for-1
9148	@handle -- You ride Ronnie and Forte in Week 10 ... unless you know for sure Westbrook won't play (and we don't know that as of Thursday)
9148	@handle -- I'd start Dustin Keller over Heap in Week 10 ... in fact, I have that exact same scenario in one of my 10 leagues ... thx!
9148	@handle -- If T.O. is the worst WR on your roster, then dump him for Gage ... and I'd drop Felix's balky knee over Choice to get Betts
9148	@handle -- I shouldn't be disrespecting Cedric -- who's been amazing this year -- but I think Mendenhall has a better game in Week 10
9148	@handle -- For your two flex spots, let's ride Welker and SidRice over Witten, V-Davis, M-Barber and Reggie Bush .. thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd start Calvin over Boldin in Week 10 ...
9148	@handle -- WITHOUT knowing who's on your team or which twosome you'd be getting ... I'd rather have AP/Palmer over Peyton/K-Smith, thx!
9148	@handle -- Your should I dump Calvin is wayyyy too vague ... who else ya got? Me personally, I am going to ride him every week ...
9148	@handle -- OH, HOW I LOVE ANSWERING DEFENSIVE QUESTIONS ... WHAT FUN!!!! Sarcasm aside, Bengals long-term ... Fins this week!
9148	For those who haven't read today's Clicks ... I cover rankings for QBs/RBs/WRs/TEs ... http://tinyurl.com/yldfr34
9148	@handle -- Use your RB depth to make trades ... slaton to moats' owner ... mccoy to westbrook's ... sell Portis/ & Betts ... BE CREATIVE!
9148	@handle -- Part 1 -- I'd start Romo over Cutler (barely) ... Part 2 -- Yes, drop Knox for Greene ...
9148	@handle -- V-Davis ... http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/fantasy/11/11/wednesday.clicks/index.html
9148	Here are today's Fantasy Clicks -- literally HOT OFF THE PRESSES!!!! http://tinyurl.com/yldfr34
9148	@handle -- Eh, I'd probably want the Palmer/Jennings end -- but it's close!
9148	@handle -- I just sent 'em to New York ... which means they'll probably be on the site by 3 p.m. ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Once again, I'm not a big fan of vague questions ... what are your other options, should you choose to dump Portis?
9148	@handle -- I would rather have Mendenhall/Bowe over Carolina's Steve Smith/P-Thomas ... due to the Chiefs' easy-cheesy sked coming up
9148	@handle -- Yes, I would definitely surrender Palmer for Addai -- in a nanosecond! ... as for your RBs, start Peterson and Beanie ...
9148	@handle -- With your current roster, I would most certainly give up P-Rivers to get back CedBenson/Carson in return ... boom!
9148	@handle -- I'd rank your RBs like this for Week 10 -- 1)J-Stew 2)Hightower 3)Fargas 4)F-Jackson ... thx!
9148	@handle -- It's not a blowout ... but I'd rather have Fitz/Felix over Wayne/Reggie Bush in a standard-scoring league ... PPR? maybe not
9148	@handle -- Dude, did you seriously ask if you should dump an extra kicker for darren sproles? I oughta ban you from here for asking that
9148	@handle -- For Gates/Flacco in a keeper ... you'd probably get someone like ryan grant, p-thomas, mendenhall, knowshone, LT, barber, etc.
9148	@handle -- That question is too broad ... I need specifics to your personal situation...
9148	@handle -- I will NEVER pass up a chance to improve my team before the deadline (no exceptions) ... but I could be happy with your RBs ..
9148	@handle -- Uh, Fitz and the Cards have the easiest playoff-sked BY A COUNTRY MILE ... l'd side with Larry ...
9148	@handle -- That's rather vague ... do I like him as a No. 4 RB? yes ... a No. 2? no ... would I kill myself to trade for him? Uh, no ...
9148	Here are the fantasyland Week 11 Revelations -- hot off the presses! (will re-post later for non-early risers) ... http://twurl.nl/a0o037
9148	@handle -- You are very welcome ... I appreciate the patronage!
9148	@handle -- Not eve Maroney or Slaton family members would pick their kin over Ray Rice and T-Jones in Week 11. ... there's your answer
9148	@handle -- If you want to go safe at the flex, go with 1)Charles 2)Burleson 3)Chambers ... if it's feast-or-famine, let's ride D-Mac ..
9148	@handle -- Looks to me like you've ALREADY decided to take that trade ... but yes, I'd rather have Ocho/Beanie over Addai/Cribbs
9148	@handle -- Boldin, Rice and Calvin ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'm not thinking of Week 12, my man ... we'll address later
9148	@handle -- This is wayyyyyyyyyy too vague a question, my man ... should he be starting for you, that's all that matters????
9148	@handle -- As for your WRS ... let's ride Driver and Steve Smith ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Honestly, I think I'd rather take my chances on Devery Henderson ... but if I had to choose, I would probably go B-Marsh ...
9148	@handle -- Ummmm, I'd go with Sims-Walker over Hightower for your PPR in Week 11 ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd go Beanie over Lynch/LJ at RB ... at WR, let's ride Boldin & V-Jax over T.O., Braylon, Walter ... and thx for the patronage!
9148	@handle -- I have lost complete confidence in Lynch (so much that F-Jax is probably better ... but in your case, let's ride McCoy/MB3
9148	@handle -- It' s your lineup and your money. Ride that hunch!
9148	@handle -- If you absolutely, positively need a home run at the flex for Week 11 ... let's ride Devery over M-Bush, Fargas, Felix, Bryant
9148	@handle -- Oh goody, a defense question ... woo-hoo!!!! I'm taking the Saints, simply because NO has the more opportunistic D ...
9148	@handle -- SInce you had no follow-up questions from before, I will assume you liked Friday's Clicks ... thx for the patronage, as always!
9148	@handle -- Wow! When push comes to shove, I'm always starting Rodgers @ home (in good weather) ... and let's ride Austin at the WR slot
9148	@handle -- Shouldn't you be asleep by now? GameDay starts in, what, 6 hours!!! Damn!
9148	@handle -- For Week 11, I'd rank your flex RBs like this: 1)McCoy 2)F-Jax 3)Betts 4)Forsett ... although it's razor-thin between all 4 ...
9148	@handle -- I would rank 'em in the exact order you wrote: 1)Mendenhall 2) SidRice 3)Jacobs 4)Steve Smith (NYG) and 5)B-Scott for Week 11
9148	@handle -- First of all, you can't go wrong either way ... both are locks for 275 yards and/or 3 TDs ... but I'd play Warner over Brady!
9148	@handle -- For your PPR, I'd rank your Week 11 WRs like this: 1)Moss 2)Rice 3)Housh 4)Holmes 5)Burleson ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd rather have Hasselbeck over Palmer (barely) ... either one would be an upgrade though
9148	@handle -- I've been condemning Flacco for a while ... given the Ravens' Rice-reliance and the upcoming slate of cold-weather games
9148	@handle -- What? Are you saying that you ask the same question to 4-5 different experts every week? Sacre bleu! (Seriously ... thx!)
9148	@handle -- For your flex option, I'd go 1)McCoy 2)Betts 3)F-Jax 4)Forsett ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Maroney vs. T-Jones ... really? REALLY? What's with all the T-Jones hatred?
9148	@handle -- OOO, tempting ... but I think I'd rather go the S-Jax route ...
9148	@handle -- I'd rank your Week 11 RBs like this: 1)Moreno 2)Grant 3)Forsett
9148	@handle -- I'm just telling you how I would do it ... Crabtree's breakout is imminent ... and he's a low-risk play against Walter
9148	@handle -- No matter the situation, I'm riding T-Jones and P-Thomas in Week 11 (over Bernard Freaking Scott) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I don't do the weekly projections (I have enough on my plate) ... but I would rather have Breaston over Santana in Week 11
9148	@handle -- This is pretty easy, actually ... let's ride Crabtree and Burleson (who LOVES playing his old team) over Olsen & Walter
9148	@handle -- Thanks, I have enough TVs ...
9148	@handle -- Yes, I think I would gladly take S-Jax for B-Marsh and LT in a PPR league -- especially if Orton is out for 1-3 weeks ...
9148	@handle -- I'd go J-Maclin over your three TEs for Week 11 ... and yes, the Friday Clicks are already out ... thx!
9148	@handle -- During crunch time, I'm going to ride Addai over the Cincy backs ... just pray for 40 receiving yards and a goal-line TD ...
9148	@handle -- I think I'd choose Slaton over Betts in Week 11 (misspelled your Twitter ID the first time -- sorry)
9148	@handle -- I think I'd choose Slaton over Betts in Week 11 .. thx!
9148	@handle -- Have I not mentioned you before? OK, I'll get to you on Wednesday -- PROVIDED you send me a Week 12 lineup question ...
9148	Here are Friday's Fantasy Clicks/Thursday Revelations ... hot off the presses! http://tinyurl.com/ylbnacu
9148	@handle -- Test my skill? Test my skill? 1)Knowshon 2)Grant 3)Caddy ... BOOM!
9148	@handle -- I would want Peyton/AP over McNabb/C-Johnson ... perhaps one of the best last-minute blockbusters you'll ever see ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd go Jacobs over Bernard Scott ... and Breaston over Lee Evans in Week 11 (although I love Evans vs. JAX, too) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I answered the Beanie/Hightower/Slaton question in today's Clicks (to be published shortly on SI.com) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I think I'd prefer the Calvin/J-Stew side, compared to the Sidney Rice (and whatever you'd find on waivers) duo ... thx!
9148	@handle -- MSW is AVERAGING 6 catches/113 yards/1 TD in home games this year ... I think the choice is clear ... especially against Walter
9148	@handle -- I understand your Barber devotion ... but I'm always going to ride the hot hand (R-Bush -- 5 TDs in 5 games) during crunch time!!
9148	@handle -- If it's a PPR league, ride Housh ... and if it's a standard-scoring one, hmmmmm ... I think I would go Jacobs (by a nose), thx!
9148	@handle -- My Fantasy Clicks come out every M/W/F ... and I do a REVIEW of each 'League' episode every Wednesday ...
9148	@handle -- I'm just telling you what I'd do ... you're under no obligation to follow the advice ...

5525	Looking to get into the adult space, starting with the MyAdultFind.com website venture. Anyone have feedback or critiques on the site?
5541	@handle This website sites the National Council on Problem Gambling as saying ~4% of all gamblers. http://bit.ly/6PdE7
5541	@handle In other words, taking away casinos ignores the root of the problem, which is what needs to be addressed.
5541	@handle The majority of people who gamble do not have gambling problems. Should we ban McDonalds because some people have eating problems?
5541	And I don't buy the casinos bring crime argument. At least not a significant amount.
5541	@handle Maybe that's the point. Apple is here to annihilate us all.
5541	@handle Not sure how I feel. I'll probably watch next week to make up my mind, but the acting sucks and there's too much lame commentary.
5541	Very poorly disguised universal healthcare jab on #V .
5541	@handle Maybe you are. There's plenty of movies and TV shows out there that are weak variations of the same thing. Why not plays?
5541	@handle Apparently my best friend was the crazy Jeopardy dude's camp counselor
5541	@handle That's actually what I was thinking about when I posted that.
5541	Would anyone in the OU administration do something like this? I've seen nothing to make me think so. http://bit.ly/13bJ6I
5541	@handle I see. I'm sorry. Hope you can get back to sleep. Maybe some tea would help?
5541	@handle Probably not. I can barely play it on guitar. But maybe eventually. I thought you were going to bed?
5541	Peter Frampton's Penny for Your Thoughts has to be one of the coolest acoustic guitar songs ever.
5541	@handle Aww. That's probably my fault. I woke up with a scratchy throat this morning. Hope you feel better.
5541	@handle Thanks for ruining my reputation on Twitter. ;-)
5541	My wonderful girlfriend got me a ukulele for my birthday. Jake Shimabukuro better watch his back.
5541	I forgot how crazy Athens Halloween is. #fb
5541	In Athens for a wonderful Halloween weekend with a wonderful lady.
5541	@handle @handle Is right. They totally should have given you something from the Target $4 list.
5541	I'm wondering if my profs write House, Grey's Anatomy, and every other med show since they're always about something I just learned about.
5541	@handle Cool. Hope it heals quick!
5541	@handle Let me know how many you get!
5541	Taking the plunge...prepping for the Windows 7 install.
5541	Practical in T-minus 15 and counting. #fb
5541	I'm thinking about trying something new the next time I get my hair cut. Any suggestions?
5541	@handle Maybe it's good that you weren't able to see a score. Less to worry about. Love you! Good luck tomorrow. I'll be praying for you!
5541	@handle Fantastic! I love the sock monkey!
5541	@handle You'll be ok. Try not to get too stressed out. Oh, and I also need a back rub, so maybe we can trade the next time we're together
5541	Can't wait to see Lebron, Shaq, and the rest of the Cavs whip the Celtics tonight.
5541	Studying in Prior forever. #fb

1416	@handle ...what do you mean?
370	Link to Carville sketch - jump to 3:25. http://bit.ly/DiXTe
370	wait for it.... wait for it...
370	Nobody puts baby (or insert councilman name) in a corner.
370	Coucilmen have complained about being cornered into tax increase so if you hear the following statement you must drink everything...
370	Drinking game for today's city council meeting? What do you think? One critical rule will follow but not sure if there will be more rules.
370	Also, waiting for the first person to criticize the mayor because the person hired worked at HDR at one point in her life.
370	Money for position came from a grant to be used for energy efficiency/conservation. Can't be used for street repairs. Get facts straight.
370	It's funny seeing people criticize Suttle for the sustainability coordinator hire. Job was posted on city website before Suttle was elected
370	@handle So, you're saying there was a failure of leadership from Festersen and Stothert?
370	Council has approved a budget! Festersen and Stothert voting no. No explanation from Festersen on no vote.
370	Jerram lecturing city council members - it's rather amusing and somewhat pertinent. You can tell he's a lawyer.
370	Congratulations Omaha - after 7 plus hours your council has not produced a budget.
370	Looks like we may be getting closer to a budget.
370	Jerram is filibustering. Vegas oddsmakers are starting to re-think odds. Jerram may be the darkhorse in boiling over.
370	@handle only if you're a lawyer - are you still there? who's leading in bathroom breaks?
370	Who will reach the boiling point first? That is the question on the table. Vegas oddsmakers have Thompson out in front.
370	Phrase of the day... Omnibus bill - legislation accepted in a single vote which contains many laws or amendments
370	Local access channel was just interrupted with kids yelling. This may have caused a heart attack with older viewers.
370	Brooowwwwn…Oh Buster Brown. Don’t let the council get you down. Don’t let Ben Gray make you frown. Ohhhh Buster Brown.
370	Buster Brown decided to shoot a councilman.
370	Oh Buster Brown had lived an ordinary life. Two kids, a dog, and a cautionary wife. While it was all going according to plan.............
370	Looks like there is back room dealing going on in the back room or they are discussing dinner plans.
370	Does anyone think Garry Gernandt looks like George Segal from Just Shoot Me http://www.zimbio.com/George+Segal
370	I'm back and the marathon city council meeting continues. What did I miss?
370	Btw, I meant director not directory. Long day. Schedule is not allowing for council meeting viewing.
370	Pete Festersen talks awfully fast. Slow down, take a breath.
370	Sorry to all the loyal followers expecting budget proposal drinking game and live tweeting. I'll try to make it up to you all somehow.
370	@handle Actually, no, raises didn't cause the pension mess. Other concessions did. U should know, you were in office when it happened.
370	Interesting, just discovered this new political blog in Omaha - www.omahablog.com - I'm disappointed in the boring name though.
370	It's over and I'm drunk. Back to work driving school kids around. I'm kidding; I'm a pilot.
370	Think I just saw American Tea Bag Lady! She's an @handle favorite!
370	Yes, we are getting some hecklers. Lady points out all the things the govt runs - defense, education, etc. and Latina woman & others heckle
370	@handle Probably at work.

8463	Taking up @handle Twitter challenge. Prepare to be schooled @handle!
4412	Do you ever wish you could undo the stupid bonehead mistakes you've made, esp. the ones that cost you 7 months of your life?
4412	@handle Awesome! Now I have to ask: where in tx? I'm in Dallas & I would hate for those eggs to spoil on the drive down to Austin, say!
4412	@handle well, I will seriously make you some so you better get ready!;)
4412	@handle u know, I've been told I make the best deviled eggs ever so...(I've never understood that. It's not like it's hard!) ;)
4412	I can't believe my ex's...whatever you want to call her, had the nerve to call me. As if I would have anything to do w/ that loser now!
4412	I'm in a meeting, 3 hours long so far, with a principal and her staff. Someone please shoot me in the head...
4412	@handle Well since u guys were going w/ song lyrics & such, I was thinking a particularly apropos name would be The Wet Dreams! ;)
4412	Cop in an unmarked car. Red light turns green. He doesn't move. I honk. He flashes his lights. Am I supposed to be impressed?
4412	By the way, there's a guy in a car behind me chewing gum so hard he looks like a toothless cow chewing beef jerky!
4412	I love when there's a low layer of fog hovering just above the ground in fields & such on cool, brisk mornings like this...:)
4412	This dude just walked into the auto repair shop that looks like a perfect cross between Dave Grohl & Hugh Laurie. Random...
4412	I guess if I'm hurt, angry, sad or frustrated, I'm not allowed to express it b/c it's too annoying to those around me thx to my past. Huh...
4412	@handle yeah, my brother sent me that and I was literally crying I was laughing so hard!
4412	http://twitpic.com/p2ntb I'm sorry, but this made me laugh in a way it probably shouldn't have...
4412	Why is it when a random memory of someone u desperately want to forget invades ur headspace, u just want to smack someone...hard?
4412	It's the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It's also the Incredible Hulk, Lou Ferrigno's b-day. R the 2 somehow related?! :)
4412	I just sat thru the worlds longest funeral procession! I freakin' lost count after 304 cars! Jeez!

4412	I have to train 200 people on child abuse and teen dating violence today. Oh joy...
4412	@handle So I had this dream that you covered this song: http://bit.ly/1NfKB2 It was breathtaking & I thought, what if...? ;)
4412	@handle That's very cool! We're so excited for you! Adrianne wants to know when we're going to get to meet Danny Glover! ;)
4412	@handle You two make magic, ok? ;) lol! Be good!
4412	I love having to drive other people's cars. Esp. when it's covered w/ political crap I find loathesome & is diametrically opposed to mine.
4412	Can my day get any shittier?
4412	Apparently I'm selfish & ungrateful. Maybe I wouldn't react that way if I didn't have a fractured vertebrae jamming into my spinal cord!
4412	$2500 for a new transmission? Seriously? Someone shoot me now...
4412	@handle Hope that didn't involve crying like a baby like my day of introspection did!
4412	It's a freakin' beautiful day in Dallas. Not a cloud in the sky. That must explain why the homeless guys by my office are so frisky...
4412	Uh, why did a homeless dude who appeared to be in his mid 70's just hit on me & ask me out? Man, I have some kind of animal magnetism! Jeez.
4412	@handle Have fun! And don't forget your, uh...box! ;)
4412	@handle See, I never even thought small penis. What does that mean? I'm tempted to insert some penis size cliche here, but...;)
4412	@handle NO YOU DIDN'T! --shaking my head--Billy, you need a serious spanking for that!!!
4412	http://twitpic.com/ntrcg Ok, I know it's oh so wrong, but how freakin' cute is my dog?!

5439	@handle Thank you.
5439	@handle Yes, the ppl in the 30's and 40's experienced exactly what we are now. We must fight it just the same.
5439	@handle You need to go to huitter.com and remove ppl that do not follow you on your list then you will be able to follow more ppl.
5439	@handle @handle Leftist values do not allow for free thought no matter how much they lie and say they do. You need us & we need you
5439	@handle @handle Christian conservative values allow for liberals and non-believers to exist among us in harmony.
5439	@handle @handle I understand that. However you the country was founded on christian conservative values.
5439	@handle The Founders Conservative Principles are all resting on the foundation of Christianity.

5439	if the leftist are not stopped what will be the tipping point where everyday americans are willing to go to jail to stop the tyranny
5439	@handle if it gets that bad itll be too late. civil unrest will happen before that
5439	@handle if not we are going to have another civil war. Totalitarian style socialism will never work here
5439	@handle i agree Conservatism is easily articulaed once you can get someone to think logically rather than emotionally
5439	its amazing that when asked none of the lawmakers supporting this can explain the constitutionality of gov health care
5439	@handle lets hope its only a war of words that are needed to stop this
5439	the 111th Congress and the President are breaking the law with gov health care
5439	there is nowhere in the constitution that allows for gov health care
5439	The constitutionality of gov health care is nonexistent in every aspect not just the purchase requirement
5439	@handle not easily done when taxes are taken before get your check.
5439	morons like @handle know not what they support
5439	@handle yeah and china n. Korea and Cuba are bastions of freedom. you really are a moron. ppl like you are anti-American
5439	@handle you are a fool to believe leftists have your liberties in mind. smaller gov is the only answer.
5439	if Texas secedes they just send troops there what then?
5439	I say a nationwide strike would be the first step. 50 to 75 million conservatives on strike would stop the economy for the gov.
5439	is there going to be another civil war because of this? this is only going to get worse.
5439	every other socialist/communist country has failed why do people believe this will work?
5439	What is going to happen if the gov. strips our liberties? just lay down and die?
5439	These people are going to destroy our country. when are people going to wake up.
5439	God bless the military men & women who are protecting us! #militarymon

5439	@handle if that happens you will suffer along with the rest of us. You still have not seen the light. Educate yourself!
5439	@handle This has nothing to do with Bush. Obama is trying to destroy the country to ensure eternal power for leftists.
5439	@handle get used to Americans being more educated and rejecting leftists like Obama and you. Liberty will prevail. #thepatriotjournal

9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone New pack for Qualifying has been posted with data to the end of session. To download Clear Local store in settings.
9577	@handle Maybe, but there has to be a commercial market for it. If the Palm Pre takes off...
9577	@handle Unusual session for us meant we had to tweak our setup. You needed to change the session back to Qualifying in setup. Sorry
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone ... select the right session using the setup screen.
9577	@handle Just a spin
9577	@handle Try our official one!
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone Qualifying to being in 15 mins. Lets hope the rain does cause too many dramas!
9577	#f1 #iphone #f1app Practice 3 posted.

9577	@handle Heh. Well we'll be there rain or shine!

9577	@handle Thankyou! Glad you like our app! Please leave us a nice review in the appstore, and look out for the next season coming soon...
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone Practice 2 race pack is now available for download. Enjoy and see you again for P3!
9577	@handle Thankyou. Glad you like it! We may take you up next season on that... ;)

9577	@handle Sorry, we're only on iPhone and ipod at present, but we are a unique way to watch F1.
9577	@handle Yes, unfortunately we're only on the iPhone. Check http://bit.ly/RB78B to see more about it.
9577	#f1 #iphone New F1 Timing App CP End of season promotional price - http://bit.ly/22mrz1
9577	@handle Yes this is what the session packs are for. tap the time and pause the race, and tap again to restart. Also can use start time setup
9577	@handle Sorry, went out for lunch! We're trying ;)
9577	@handle Note race start is the time the lights go *green* not 1pm after warm up lap (normally more like 1.03pm).
9577	@handle The problem is you need to know when the race starts. After that is set, it will always be in sync. #f1
9577	@handle It can already do that, but you need to know the race start time. Set the start time to the session start and go to race #f1
9577	#f1 #iphone #f1app Race pack will be available from 8:10 +1 hr (BST)
9577	@handle Unfortunately yes. 2010 will be a whole new app. Pricing and availability yet to be announced...
9577	@handle I@handle Tweet us how you get on. In the UK works fine ok over GPRS
9577	@handle If you like our app please leave us a review
9577	@handle not at the moment, but we are watch for an appropriate way to do it...
9577	@handle no.
9577	@handle Wince isn't on our radar at the moment. Nice hardware, but market not. Personally had bad consumer exp 2 yrs ago (crashes)
9577	@handle We give a limited number of codes to journalists, but each has to be vetted (we get quite a lot of requests). Email us details.
9577	@handle The starter pass will be released in a full pre season launch closer to the season. Current version for the already decided! #f1
9577	F1 2010 Timing App in the appstore http://bit.ly/89kbEo 2.1 version now shows news in app. #f1 #iphone #f1app
9577	@handle why thankyou! Leave us a nice review if it's not too much trouble!
9577	@handle We're looking at Blackberry, but the source is C, and currently Blackberry it appears Blackberry only supports Java.
9577	@handle Biggest is a race - about 4-5 meg. Practice and Qual come in around 2Meg. This year a little bigger than last, cos more ;)
9577	@handle Yes. Even better than that it should work fine over GPRS or where ever you have a data connection.
9577	@handle Sorry, the 2010 season is a new app. 2010 CP will give you full access to the 120+ hrs of sessions in 2010 though! #f1
9577	F1 2010 Championship pass now available - http://bit.ly/89kbEo Discounted before the New Year #f1 #iphone #f1app
9577	@handle You're not following so I cannot DM you ;). Not at the moment, though watch this feed for more info.
9577	@handle We're looking at the Symbian S60 devices, but we're still in proving stages. Watch this feed for updates!
9577	@handle We're investigating the feasibility of doing an Android version, yes. Watch this feed for more updates...
9577	@handle Thanks, UK data coverage in Oxford is rarely better than GRPS, so we said it must work with that!
9577	#f1 #iphone #f1app New version in review has an improved news reader that no longer quits. Sorry for not fixing this earlier...
9577	@handle yes. We have to pay the team of engineers, they get grouchy otherwise...
9577	@handle it is a new app for a new season. New features coming would break on 09 data.
9577	F1timing app 2010 is now available. Dicounted before new year, keep it up to date, new feature coming soon! #f1
9577	Hmm. iPod 8G 3G *is* different to the 2G. The screen seems very yellowy and seems flickery.Cheaper parts? Maybe I just have a bad one. #ipod
9577	@handle The app is being improved for 2010 - faster, smoother, better - work will be complete by the start of the season...
9577	Objective-C -> straight C = 6x performance, and 4 times less memory ;)
9577	@handle If you want to look at the 2009 championship, yes. Otherwise wait for the 2010 App which will be available before Christmas #f1
9577	@handle 2010 will be a whole new app. It will be in the appstore at Christmas, with a larger update before the beginning of the season
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone - that's it we're out! Race will be packaged shortly! Thakyou everyone for watching our first season.Hope you enjoyed it!
9577	£
9577	#f1 #iphone #f1app All set for Yas Marina Qualifying...
9577	#f1 #iphone Practice 2 session pack now available!
9577	@handle Yeah, looks like that doesn't it ;). The next point on was being reported as the start finish line, so a jump forward and back
9577	#f1app Problem with turns 15-16 will be fixed in next session.
9577	@handle Thanks Marco, didn't know that one! Glad you like the app!
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone Practice 2 underway!
9577	@handle Try full restart of the phone (hold both buttons down 10secs). Sounds like the OS has pinched too much memory, and needs a reboot
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone Currently we have a sequencing problem with our loops, around turn 15-16. Working to resolve it...
9577	@handle Yes we're looking at doing that.
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone hope everyone has upgraded to 1.6 which has an improved Abu Dhabi map. Yas Marina deserves it! Stunning...
9577	#f1 #iphone #f1app Abu Dhabi Practice 1 begins in 10 mins!
9577	@handle Undecided, but running the practice sessions is an expense - in terms of run time they take more effort than the actual race!
9577	@handle Any time before christmas ;)
9577	@handle Possibly.
9577	@handle We'll watch the Pre, but in our view its not quite established enough yet.
9577	@handle we already support full replay, after the event, so you can sync to dvrs. #f1
9577	@handle The commercials are complex, so at present we're mobile only. In the future, who knows?
9577	@handle We're not actually game, we're mobile technical timing feed during the races. http://www.softpauer.com

6595	It's beginning to look like a 4-player logjam for the LF/DH spots in Texas. So far Byrd and Blalock are getting more ABs than Murphy/Jones.
6595	Wang v. Uehara matchup on Wednesday yielded ZERO strikeouts by the two starting pitchers. I can't believe that happens very often.
6595	Lineup lessons learned so far? Tony La Russa will tinker on a daily basis. Shocking! Read the April 7 Extract. http://tiny.cc/xPZFJ
6595	New Daily Extract is posted, pointing out surprises in Opening Day rosters. http://tiny.cc/50lcr
6595	Peeking at the lineups in tonights Atl/Phi game - no surprises. Jordan Schafer batting #8 is just confirmation, not a surprise.
6595	Definition of Baker's Dozen -- Number of fantasy teams on which I own Scott Baker. Aargh! (Shift everyone up one and add RA Dickey as #5)
6595	From Sabathia to Suppan on opening day: One small step for Jeff, One giant leap downward for the Milwaukee Brewers.
6595	Skip Schumaker to bat #9 vs. lefties and #1 vs. righties. That is downright weird.
6595	Some are calling it Devine-intervention. Brad Ziegler will be the closer in Oakland. If you picked him up cheap in your auction: Miraculous.
6595	Nah. We'll eat your $14,000,000 salary this year. Nah. We don't care that you are on the brink of 500 HR immortality. Bye bye, Gary.
6595	Despite my brilliant move of snagging J.A. Happ at auction for $1, the Phils are not playing along. Chan Ho Park will be the #5 starter.
6595	Score another win for the Netherlands: with Hochevar sent down, Sir Sidney Ponson has a chance to belly flop his way into the rotation in KC
6595	Gardner declared starting CF in NY. A new source of SB has entered the fantasy game.
6595	News that B. Morrow will close in Seattle will send Lowe, Batista, Aardsma, Corcoran, and Cordero to the wire in lots of fantasy leagues.
6595	Kris Benson may be in line for a rotation spot in Texas. Nice to see a Benson story without an annoying mention of Anna. Oh, sorry.
6595	Forget about Meet the Press and Face the Nation. I'll be watching Lou Piniella on Sunday to hear him explain why it's Gregg & not Marmol.
6595	Carlos Villaneuva will close in Milwaukee until either 1) Hoffman gets healthy or 2) the Curse of the Brewer Pen renders him ineffective.
6595	Girardi talks about a swap at the top of the Yankee's batting order: Jeter/Damon/Teixeira/Matsui/Nady/Posada/Cano/Ransom/Gardner
6595	Skip Schumaker will start at 2B for the Cardinals, say GM John Mozeliak. Who woulda thunk this would happen one month ago.
6595	Can you believe this? Saunders/Weaver/Moseley/Adenhart/Loux may be the rotation to begin the year in Anaheim. Tex would look good about now.
6595	Believe it or not, the Nationals rotation is beginning to look like this: Lannan/Olsen/Cabrera/Zimmerman/Martis.
6595	Before writing Dontrelle into the Tigers rotation based on 4 shutout innings against minor leaguers, consider IT WAS AGAINST MINOR LEAGUERS!
6595	Put me down for Franklin Morales as the fifth starter in Colorado. Making it Cook/Jimenez/Marquis/de la Rosa/Morales.
6595	The definitive proof that left-handedness by itself is a great asset is the continued talk that Horacio Ramirez will be a SP in Kansas City.
6595	With Scott Lewis announced as #4 starter in Cleveland, here is how the rotation shapes up: Lee/Carmona/Pavano/Lewis/Reyes.
6595	Micah Owings appears to have #5 rotation spot sewed up in Cincinnati, making for a tasty rotation: Volquez/Harang/Arroyo/Cueto/Owings.
6595	The Yankee CF battle is an interesting one. Gardner is making a solid case this spring. Melky has always struck me as a fourth outfielder.
6595	Mike Redmond is the #1 catcher in Minnesota until further notice. Who really knows if Mauer will miss one week or three months?
6595	Count on Shawn Hill to grab a spot in the Padres rotation.
6595	Just added myself to the http://wefollow.com twitter directory under: #baseball #mlb #lineups
6595	Scioscia says he is thinking of keep Howie Kendrick in the #2 slot in the batting order. That would be a big boost in HK's run totals.
6595	Chris Getz in as starting second baseman for the White Sox.. Nix to bench. Beckham to minors. http://tiny.cc/g2Ffm
6595	Blue Jays rotation suffers further insult. Janssen to start season in extended spring training or in the minors: http://tiny.cc/2EYtJ

1816	http://twitpic.com/n2j8d - Who's bad!? :D
1816	Here is a hint.. I totally just bought a pair of black skinny girl jeans and a leather jacket with chains.. :D
39	@handle Joooinnnnnn usssssssssss.
39	@handle This is why I'm glad I am a micro-manager. It means I can skip that skillset, and also stop the stoopid.
39	My hype and early AM playing convinced my other roommate to purchase L4D2. :P
39	Excellent, within a few hours of my contacting Gamefly via their website, they sent an apology and redacted the erroneous charges.
39	@handle Can't speak for MW2, but I'm enjoying AC2 so far. Much more refined than the first. No multiplayer, though.
39	Drooling at this page (http://bit.ly/2leOa4) My messenger is finally dying (though it lasted five years!).
39	@handle Assassin's Creed 2.
39	I like that Grasp is available from the beginning in AC2.
39	@handle I was just charged three times for a game I decided to keep. Hope we can remedy this?
39	@handle Was it perhaps taken down? Or is this something more tech-related?
39	Gamefly, I may have decided to keep the game I am currently renting, yes. But why are you charging me for it three times?
39	That was a nap I needed.
39	Every once in a while, instead of just shrugging off a complaint, I like responding with a comment that deflates the other.
39	Need to step away from the computer before I start yelling at my connection. Need to talk to roomie about whether the problem is the router.
39	@handle I wish I had invites. :-/
39	Which reminds me. Do people want a L4D2 and AC2 Wave? If so, who wants to be part of the discussion?
39	@handle Maybe after I play some more, Corvus and I can have public Twitter discussions about it. :P
39	@handle Sorry I dropped from our earlier game; my connection kept kicking me then having a fit-start, then kicking me, et cetera.
39	@handle Hard Rain is the most ridiculous. Sugar Mill has multiple witches roaming about.
39	-.- Comcast is like a lover of whom I know I should rid myself, but am addicted to staying.
39	Internet connection, of all the days to fuck up...
39	AC2. Il Dottore!
39	Gnome!
39	Did I mention I love Rochelle? Yay for more black female protagonists in games!
39	Katana? Decapitation of zombies? Excellent.
39	There's a lot to like about the attention to detail in L4D2. Take an adrenaline shot and notice how the sound effects change.
39	Of course my internet connection wants to act up tonight; of course. Sigh.
39	Yay! First game I'm Rochelle!
39	@handle Billy Corgan is also insane now.
39	L4D2 decrypting. Guess I should go pop in AC2 and let it install as well.
39	It's okay. I brought a book.
39	I'm so rarely around gamers that aren't friends who indulge with me discussing games. This? This is strange.
39	Then again, I know not what to expect at the end. Just a feeling I get.
39	I have a sneaking suspicion that I hampered some end-fight with allies with the decision I just made in DA:O. Made it anyway.
39	@handle Also, realize I do not have your Steam name. Mine is the same as this handle.
39	@handle I was thinking much the same. Glad I'm going to pick up AC2. Hopefully up when I get back.
39	Will go through first campaign, and then try AC2 for a bit.
39	After I pick up AC2, I believe I'll come back and play L4D2.
39	Made a decision based purely on the fact that I respect Shale; otherwise never a decision this character would make.
6512	@handle Amazon S3 is your best choice, IMO. Dirt-cheap, very reliable. Can use AllwaySync to back up.
6512	@handle 2 ATI Digital Cable Tuners, 2 Aver USB Volar HD for OTA (excellent), Silicon Dust HDHomeRun (interesting but flawed)
6512	@handle I'll be writing it up next week for ZDNet. I quit DirecTV back in Feb 2008 and haven't looked back
6512	@handle Old school ATI digital cable tuners
6512	@handle Have had them all for ages. Two ATI OCUR tuners, an HDHomeRun (2x), one Aver Volar USB
6512	Media Center relocated to the living room. Two cable tuners, 3 OTA HD tuners. Shockingly easy. Cable guy didn't have to do a thing.
6512	@handle Thanks! It's been one of my faves for years, perhaps because of the location, outside city hall Florence, Italy
6512	@handle With your cable company's help, yes. You still have to pair with their CableCARDs, but BIOS restrictions are gone.
6512	@handle I've seen lots of errors with Hotmail/Live accounts but none with POP/SMTP and Exchange
6512	@handle The server and client versions shown in your pic are correct
6512	@handle That's the right current version. Is there any other PC on the network with a lower version?
6512	@handle Are you using the Outlook Connector with web-based mail accounts?
6512	@handle Sounds like a router issue upstream from you. Have you tried a tracert to the domains in question?
6512	@handle What happened?
6512	@handle Look in Control Panel, Programs, for version number of HP MediaSmart Server Software. What is it?
6512	@handle I'm always embarrassed when I am on the wrong end of that equation. Have learned from experience to check before sending a DM
6512	michaelwolf Got your DM but can't respond because you don't follow me.
6512	@handle That might have fixed it. Chipset, storage drivers can cause the sort of errors you've been seeing
6512	@handle Do you have an Intel ICH8/9 SATA controller? If so, you need a new driver for it
6512	@handle Feel free to DM me if you want personalized help. Writing a post on how to troubleshoot these errors, so data is useful
6512	@handle I hear you re frustration. That is not normal behavior. You have a driver or HW problem that needs to be resolved.
6512	@handle To reset IE8 after Flash uninstall, Tools menu, Internet Options, Advanced tab, click Reset button
6512	@handle You have a bad add-in. Probably Flash. Uninstall Flash completely, then reset browser, reinstall. http://bit.ly/2mrj3Y
6512	@handle Actually, you've just described the Techmeme algorithm in full. ;)
6512	@handle No, your backups will remain, and when you reconnect everything will be there.
6512	@handle Sorry, I always react that way when I see a link to an interesting article that is behind a paywall.
6512	@handle On our next trip to Italy, we hope to see the Amalfi Coast and other parts of the south
6512	@handle I have to pay $79 to read more than a teaser? Thanks for the link, but no thanks.
6512	@handle No, that was taken in Firenze, in front of the old city hall (look at the shadow of David on the wall)
6512	@handle Do you recognize the location?
6512	@handle Isn't that the date SkyNet is supposed to become operational? ;)
6512	Why I don't follow the usual suspects RT @handle: Condensed version of my RSS feed. Blah blah blah Tablet. Blah blah blah Chrome.
6512	RT @handle: Copy Editor: “Why am I a journalist? I don’t even drink.”
6512	@handle I'll slink away now... Anyone know where the after party is?
6512	@handle Congratulations on the new job, Ray! Sounds like an exhilarating first week.
6512	@handle OK, then, one more, slightly different but still powerful: Blind Willie McTell
6512	@handle I still get goose bumps when I hear that. It's a true story, btw. William Zanzinger just died last year.

4159	I'm totally whipped from CD mastering all day - almost finished. Normally would take my time & use really fresh ears. Don't have the time.
4159	Don't forget to pick up your new Embers Christmas album @ www.theembersband.net - I think you'll like it.
4159	I just realized thanksgiving is this week. MAN - I've been too busy...
4159	Our brand new Embers Christmas album now available. A perfect stocking stuffer or holiday gift. Pick one up at www.theembersband.net
4159	http://twitpic.com/qh94d - I wonder where the hunger goes? It's like it's just gone...
4159	The Embers 2nite at the Black Angus in Statesville, NC. Visit www.thembersband.net for details. Stop by for dinner & a show! A nice place...
4159	Pulled off at a truck stop to repair an issue with bus generator & saw one of Jaxson's teammates Zach. His Dad is also a coach. Nice people!
4159	Wound too tight - not enough time to even shower today. As much as I love this time of year, it seems I can't slow down enough to enjoy it.
4159	http://twitpic.com/qc2rl - This is good!!! Thank you Shooter & Dave for the invite...
4159	We just played one ass kickin' sorority semi-formal at Red's in Raleigh. The best party we've ever played here. One dude called me Sir - boo
4159	http://twitpic.com/q7gg9 - He seemed happy warming up the bass fiddle before the show. Not sure what happened.
4159	The sink is full & the living room's a mess - but MAN I'm so happy to be home! If I don't do anything else, I'm sleepin late! Nite All...
4159	Just leaving the venue from our first Christmas show of the season. Very happy with the showgram. Went well & crowd response was AWESOME!!
4159	Trying to remember lyrics to all the new Christmas tunes we're doing this year. Think I may need to plant a cheat sheet or two. 1st show 2nt
4159	Looking forward to our first Xmas show of the season tomorrow. We've yet to do a complete run thru. Maybe no one will notice! Nice crowd plz
4159	http://twitpic.com/q1g3f - Playing the huge Auto Show in Charlotte - this is my next vehicle. It's parked beside the stage!
4159	I'm about to go to bed. Been up for 24 hrs. Gotta leave for a show at 2p today. The Good news - the new Embers Christmas CD is complete...
4159	You wouldn't believe how much I have to do & with little time. I'll find a way.
4159	So much to do today. Gotta record vox and begin mixdown for new Embers Christmas album. Must complete rest session first!
4159	In description of a song - daminiciously groovifiable. SEE! It's so easy to use this word (daminicious)! Trac came up with this one...
4159	http://twitpic.com/pp0vv - We're at dinner with Tracie's Dad & Step Mom. She was surprised with a Mexican bday serenade!
4159	http://twitpic.com/poctn - My Tizzy B hangin' at the game with me! Ain't she cool!
4159	Game Over. Tired of $6.25 16 oz. beers. Liver needs more at a better rate! Decisions, Decisions...
4159	Wildman (featured in earlier photo) heaved a pile and had to leave! Now we can see a little better.
4159	You know how sentimental I am. You know I like that kinda shit! We've had a few drinks and are laughing our asses off! Ignore vulgar words
4159	So the boys & I gave Trac a new anniversary/wedding/40th/diamond for her birthday. I said, I really hope you like it. She says......
4159	http://twitpic.com/pnmju - We shouldn't - but we are!
4159	http://twitpic.com/pnhi2 - My view at the Panthers game. Wildman & D. Williams are hard core fans!

9127	The U.S. poverty measure is out-of-date and fails to give a true picture of a family’s income, resources and public benefits.
9127	Better data means making sure we are “counting what counts”, and holding ourselves accountable to good results for children and families.

2567	My Nokia E71 got RAN OVER by a car. RIP. Best phone I ever owned.
2567	@handle Thats the same as *#7370#, to be used on non-booting phones. at again, it does NOT reformat C: on FOTA+UDP devices.
2567	@handle FOTA does its job well. But FOTA+UDP makes this sick phone a brick. NO WAY for user to recover. That should not happen.
2567	@handle I think the FOTA design should be able to account for application bugs. Thats the whole idea!
2567	I assume they will have a way to reload the full factory image. Not sure how to proceed going forward; the bug will kill the phone again.
2567	@handle Nope. The hard reset only deletes data/settings it knows about. cannot handle bugs/corruption.
2567	@handle did you see my blog entry?
2567	@handle Becase the reset just erases data it KNOWS about. the memory bug created unknown files that persist after the reset, or a re-flash
2567	@handle Have you seen this issue with Nokia FOTA? http://bit.ly/qxlOA
2567	Nokia's FOTA (Firmware Over The AIr) implementation is flawed. See why I think so: http://bit.ly/qxlOA

2567	@handle Steve, pretty sure s60 are ALL 3.3v. Even the original 3650 has a 3.7v battery in it.

5566	Es una salida cobarde y para cobardes... pero mi valentia hace mucho que se esta muriendo de a poco y no se cuanto mas aguante asi...
5566	Por esa esperanza que, ilusa, no muere... ///For all the things/You belive in/ Make some Noise...!!!/// (Noise - Humanoid-TH)
5566	peque irina, ahijada hermosa te adoro! No les parece lindaa? la dejo en mi avatar porq es la cosita mas linda del mundo y YO soy su madrina!
5566	Trato de entender lo inentendible y justificar lo injustificable...
5566	Mafalda dijo: Todos creemos en el país, lo que no se sabe es si a esta altura el país cree en nosotros Alguien esta deacuerdo con ella?
5566	@handle Disculpen que los moleste, pero... no salio!!! el 8 no salio la version deluxe :S :(... donde las venderian?
5566	No te enojes, pero es que significa que todo sigue igual, y que casi 50 años no sirvieron de nada, ni al pais, ni al continente, ni al mundo
5566	¿Y no será que en este mundo hay cada vez más gente y menos personas?> siempre tan actual, mi querida Mafalda..y creo que es lo mas triste
5566	En todas partes del mundo ha funcionado siempre muy bien la ley de las compensaciones, al que sube la voz, le bajan la caña...
5566	¿No será acaso que ésta vida moderna está teniendo más de moderna que de vida? --> Quino querido, nunca nos faltes!(I?Mafalda)
5566	¡Sonamos muchachos! ¡Resulta que si uno no se apura a cambiar el mundo, después es el mundo el que lo cambia a uno! -> Mafalda, IDOLA!!
5566	Que verguenza... Quienes dicen ser nuestra voz en el gobierno, insisten en aprobar la compra de las tijeras que cortaran nustra libertad...
5566	Estoy de luto_Veo como se subastan mi libertad y mi futuro... pero me sellaron mi voz con una ley que me sentencia...
5566	Estoy cansada, me duelen los ojos... y perdi las esperanzas...
5566	Estoy cansada... hoy me di cuenta de que mis esperanzas suicidas no tienen cabida en un mundo que se esmera por matarlas... Toy depre... :(

5566	Negra vos te fuiste, pero viviras eterna en todos los que alguna vez escuchamos una de tus canciones..mensajes eternos de vida, lucha y amor
5566	Porq? porq son las voces mas dulces las que mueren{? porq son las voces que dan vida las que se van primero?
5566	Un Angel como vos no morirá nunca... Sole te vas a vola por otros cielos... Serca de nuestros corazones y muy dentro de nuestras almas...?
5566	Adios Negra querida...Porq tu musica y tus mensajes te hicieron eterna, el amor a la propia tierra q nos diste, nunca desapareceran
5566	Fuerza Negraa!!! Porque donde tu voz calla, me pierdo eb el silencio de mi soledad... Estamos todos con vos!!!! ???

912	@handle I have! Couldn't believe you killed a man with a pogo stick!
912	Enjoying Night of the Living Dead and then heading up to Court Street for a little while to check out the costumes.
912	How did I never notice Michael Myers drove a station wagon in the original Halloween. Such a soccer mom.
912	Everyone who caught Ghost Adventures Live! check this out. http://bit.ly/3olT5G
912	@handle She totally is.
912	Next up is The Fall of the House of Usher (1960). My first time watching a Poe adaptation. DO NOT DISAPPOINT ME :|
912	I'll be going back and forth between Ghost Adventures Live and watching WVU get their asses kicked. Good evening.
912	Bought The Stangers, 1408, and The Fall of the House of Usher for 7 bucks today. I love The Strangers. Hope the other two are good.
912	@handle watching Leprechaun for the first time. Did you just kill pogo stick a man to death?!
912	@handle i'm not sure if you watched the clip, but it's one of the best Bale Batman impressions ever.
912	I like how I can't pay my friends to come here for Halloween. Kinda tells me something. Watching movies for the rest of the evening.
912	I get to practice for one hour...again. I'd love it if my schedule would quit being a douche. Ohio Sports Zone live, 8:00, channel 25.
912	1 class, 1 practice, 1 episode of Ohio Sports Zone until Halloween in Athens. it just smells epic.
912	@handle neither did mine. i'm kind of hating on baseball at the moment.
912	RT @handle We’re giving away 10 free airline tickets today! FOLLOW @handle & RT this msg to be eligible to win. http://bit.ly/3hZo37
912	i can only go to practice for 45 minutes tonight. Fuck off, accounting. quit taking things I love away from me.
912	Hoping for a Benglas win today. Can't tell you how pleased I'd be if Chespeake, Marshall, AND Cincinnati take home W's this weekend.
912	I've decided that Paranormal Activity is a decent film and definitely worth a watch, but NOWHERE near as scary as people made it out to be.
912	Saw Paranormal Activity tonight. Not too sure how I feel about it yet.
912	Heading to the stadium. Go Herd!!!
912	Peake pulled a huge upset tonight and I fully expect Marshall to win tomorrow so that all of my teams win. Go Herd!!
912	hell of a game, Peake!
912	Rainy Ohio makes me sleep 2 hours more than I planned. Every. Single. Time.
912	RT @handle Live Premier @ The Front Room 10/22 -8pm....BE THERE!
912	Library time! I'm in an Edgar Allan Poe mood..not to bury people alive or kill old men and hide them under the floor...just to read his work
912	Marshall lost and broke my heart for the 4th year in a row. heading back to Athens and cursing Mark Snyder the whole way.
912	RT Sue Sylvester plays Russian Roulette with a fully loaded revolver. And wins.
912	it would make my entire year if we pull an upset against WVU. my hatred for that school is ridiculous. GO HERD!
912	@handle i know EXACTLY what i do. what I tweeted was 100% truth.

2362	Finally saw Milk in its entirety. Am so glad I grew up after the time of Anita Bryant & glad that tolerance is the majority now.

2729	@handle You're still going to have jobs that are always going to pay minimum wage and don't do raises unless it raises (retail comes to
2729	@handle Uh yeah. and people are always arguing against raising it. gods forbid we have a livable minimum wage!

1081	November 24, 2009 is 'Ben Olsen Day' by order of the Mayor of DC.
1081	Proclamation from Mayor Fenty for Ben Olsen...
1081	Ben Olsen: I enjoyed the game more as I got older. I slowed down and wasn't as streaky.
1081	Ben Olsen: I would not like to be considering for the head coaching job. I am in no way ready for that role.
1081	Ben Olsen: To sum my career up, I was a product of the environment - great coaches, great players and a great organization.
1081	Ben Olsen: Bruce made my career - he taught me how to play. I'm very grateful.
1081	Ben Olsen: One of the best decisions I ever made was going down to UVA and meeting Bruce Areana... he'll tell you that.
1081	Ben Olsen: the only person who is the heart and soul of this team is Kevin Payne.
1081	Ben Olsen: Jaime - he gets his own list [of the best players]. He will forever in this League.
1081	Ben Olsen: Of all the players in the history of the MLS, I've played with the best players - there's no question.
1081	Ben Olsen: The one thing I know I'll miss is the crowd and the support they give me... The Heart of the Lion banner - I still get chills.
1081	Ben Olsen: I can't believe this was my career. I was lucky. There weren't many things I didn't get to experience.
1081	Ben Olsen: I'm so lucky. I can't believe that I've been through this stuff.
1081	Ben Olsen: The more I think about it, it's a feeling of relief - not having to deal with the pain for another year.
1081	Kevin Payne: We should not let this pass without remarking on his contribution to the community, too.
1081	Kevin Payne: There have been many, many great players at D.C. United.. but, I don't know if any of them has made a greater impact
1081	Kevin Payne: This is a bittersweet day for all us.

8546	America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves Abe Lincoln

8546	I wonder if I say my name enough if I can trend? Chris Knorr
8546	I wonder if @handle says my name enough If I will become a trending topic, and still be alive?
8546	@handle is still a dork. Luv ya mean it.
8546	7 days have passed and no John McCain from AZ. He just won't follow me.
8546	Why does John McCain not follow me?
8546	So A congressman vented. So what. Not certain the office of President should be disrespected that way. I am also a fan of speaking up!
8546	Here is my questions after watching the address last evening. Does the shoe fit? Is the President a liar? Whats your opinion?
8546	@handle I think it's great. Beats the heck out of a boring meeting. Passion is good. Yelling was a nice form of expression. My2¢
8546	@handle definitely the amoeba.
8546	@handle get some sleep. It's a long trip.
8546	RT @handle: How to lose your job via Facebook status: http://om.ly/IpvI AC Please Read this Young Americans
8546	RT @handle: When you get clear about what you want you will move in the direction like a powerful and magnetic force! I say YES to this
8546	Tomorrow is looking like a rocking good sales day. I expect to close 90-100% of my calls. I planned ahead and it looks good!
8546	Tonight was grand! 33 fresh sales students at UCF all ready to take the huge leap in to professional selling. It is great to give to them.
8546	One more thing from my road trip to KCMO. In southern Missouri they pronounce it Missoura. It's ok to mimic as long as you're genuine.
8546	@handle You know I'm sure he has a bd. It was just cool to see him interact with the little girl who was asking.
8546	Attn Sales People. If you could read one new book on selling this year. What would it say to you? I'm curious to know what you think.
8546	@handle Yes I would. But we are talking about the Lords Prayer here. not thatmuch deviation.
8546	@handle In a word yes. Even were I attend regular I say a couple of things different. It's still a moment of worship. So yes.
8546	@handle or cats I suppose

8546	@handle I knew you were a crack head. I just knew it.
8546	Did you know you can sub toothpicks for candles @ a bd party when mom realizes there is no candle. Wow.
8546	OK not sure what I just saw. But Pres Obama and wife. Were they READING the Lords Prayer at Kennedy's Funeral? Looked like it to me.
8546	China will account for 15-20% of all iPhone sales in 2010, says analyst http://ow.ly/mNVF

8546	@handle I fear that you are a zombie. ?Ut you ate your own brain by mistake. Pleas be more careful
8546	@handle dork. In 10 years I'll be 55 and retired with millions in the bank.
4167	Seth Greenberg called one of the refs by his first name from across the court. The guy behind me heard him...
4167	7:56 left in first half - UNC-Greensboro 20, #Hokies 18. By the way, Duke beat UNC-Greensboro by 34, 96-62
4167	Yeah, this whole Cassell Guard thing isn't working out. Just tried to start the Tarheel rejects chant to absolutely no avail
4167	Delaney checks back in at the 9:49 mark. Still walking gingerly.
4167	Delaney comes up hobbling after a drive to the basket. #Hokies 14, UNC-Greensboro 13 with 11:58 to go in the half
4167	#Hokies score six in a row to go up 12-7. UNC-G calls timeout to stop the run with 13:48 left in first half
4167	Ben Boggs the first one off the bench for the #Hokies
4167	#VT a bit sloppy. 3 turnovers before the first timeout
4167	15:08 - UNC-Greensboro 7, #Hokies 6
4167	#Hokies showing a possession 1-3-1 zone here in the early going
4167	Same starting 5 for the #Hokies tonight against UNC-Greensboro
4167	By the way, Bill Belichick was right to go for it on 4th down.
4167	Under 4:00 Timeout: #Hokies 63, Brown 49.
4167	Under 12:00 timeout: #Hokies 45, Brown 38. Brown is not going away.
4167	Under 16:00 timeout in 2nd half: #Hokies 38, Brown 30.
4167	And yes, the student fan group called the Cassell Guard has its own intro video...
4167	In Cassell Guard news, seemed like a non-factor in the first half. Didn't really notice anything different other than their intro video.
4167	Halftime: #Hokies 34, Brown 23. Delaney with 10. Davila with 7.
4167	Under 4:00 Timeout: #Hokies 31, Brown 19
4167	2nd Timeout: #Hokies 18, Brown 14. Delaney with 10 for VT
4167	and Boggs from Hidden Valley
4167	Thompson and Witcher first off the bench for the #Hokies.
4167	You can tell the #Hokies focused on defense in the preseason. Pretty impressive. #VT 11, Brown 5 at first timeout.
4167	#Hokies starting five: Delaney, Allen, Bell, Hudson, Davila
4167	So... the debut of the Casell Guard. We'll see how this goes.
4167	Wow... #Maryland has won six of its last eight games against ranked teams. #Hokies on upset alert... in brand new uniforms.
4167	WOW... Ty Lawson. Just... WOW
4167	#WakeForest forward Al-Farouq Aminu with 25 points and 13 boards. 3-for-5 from 3 pt range. He shot 18% from behind the arc last year.
4167	@handle HA... Don't worry Virginia Tech/Brown updates coming on Sunday. I know you can't wait.
4167	Turning into a good one... #Radford 62, Navy 60. 3:54 to play
4167	7:30 to play, #Radford 58, Navy 53
4167	@handle That is one of the funnier things I have read on Twitter.
4167	With you 100% RT @handle Re NBA: Giving up No.23 is a joke. I would have been more impressed if it was No. 42.

9585	@handle ROMBAL isn't happening. Sorry!
9585	Taking a trip down memory lane. Bad idea? I think so.
9585	Glee is on, so freaking happy :D
9585	Paige just told me to do my work. Yeah, I've been really lazy today. At least I did laundry?
9585	People need to get their shit out of the dryers! Hogging up all of the space!
9585	I want to be back in the bay already! I miss my family, BFFL, DAE, home-cooked meals, bed, etc. Just about two more weeks.
9585	What's up with me sleeping so early now? This is just too weird..
9585	State Street date with my one and only Mischelle :)
9585	Cramming three hours before my fem studies midterm resulted in a B+. That's pretty good, in my opinion.
9585	Last night, I went to sleep around 11:30 because my head was spinning.
9585	WTF I HAVE A PAPER DUE TOMORROW FOR FEM STUDIES.
9585	@handle ALMOST, Gerardo! I'm so swift that I avoided that bike accident! Aight, bro?!
9585	@handle I tried a milk tea pearl drink from the Taiwanese club.. not legit. When I am home, I want one from YOU! :)

9585	Adrenaline rush! Almost got into a bike accident. I'm wide-awake now!
9585	Almost slept with my contacts on. Thanks for waking me up, Mischelle!
9585	Look what technology has done: someone has to change our facebook pw so we can focus and study.
9585	Sigh, Eric always wants to match with me.. I guess that's what BFFs do nowadays!
9585	This is not going to be one of my best lab write-ups. Fuck it, I'm sick and I just want to get it over with.. bad mentality.
9585	I must get better.. three more midterms to go..
9585	NO FACEBOOK UNTIL TUESDAY.

9585	Tonight, I can sleep. Thanks, nyquil!
9585	Vivian to Eric: When you try to make someone feel better, you don't talk about yourself.
9585	Yeah, I'm not okay. And YOU could care less about me. Thanks, friend.
9585	Totally unexpected, but it was a good night with the roomies. I am surprised that I am up right now.
9585	I was supposed to sleep at 12.. that didn't work out too well.
9585	Yeah, bitches! B+ on my fem paper and I started at 11 PM and had a 5 hour energy! No more procrastinating, though.
9585	One thing is standing in my way of sleep: lab. Today is seriously not my day :(
9585	Sad reality. RT @handle: They say people in your life are seasons, and anything that happens is for a reason.
9585	Thanks for all of the good luck text messages. It's making my day a little bit better.
9585	I need to cram for fem studies ASAP! Can I get out of bio lab already?!
9585	Today is going to be such a long day. I hate Thursdays. Period.
9585	Bio lab quiz, fem studies midterm, and ochem lab tomorrow. I can't study right now. Too loud. My head is throbbing. Oh my freaking god.
9585	Don't mean to sound like a bitch, but don't be mad when I refuse to help you next time. Remember, you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

703	@handle Come on! I think that he meant less likely to engage in talks or accept a deal.
703	@handle But I think that QE + Reinforcing Stimulus is working. We just need more of them. My view on Fed Ind + Head is M.Friedman's.
703	@handle I'm a Pragmatist. The only way to know is to try it. That's why I favor Limited Banking. We've tried the current system.
703	@handle For me, QE is about altering expectations, not liquidity. You'll only increase liquidity by alt exp. I think Bernanke agrees.
703	@handle That's worth a shot.
703	@handle Since it's very risky, you're talking subsidy in some form. You're going to need an incentive as a catalyst. IOW,Govt. help.
703	@handle Yes. Even if yr a corp, which defeats the point of being a corp. What about tax credits for small business investors?
703	@handle He should have locked in higher rates long ago, since he's a long term investor. His problem is that he needs to wait now.
703	@handle Yes. His bond strategy seemed odd, but his concern about risk wasn't. Small businesses are very risky.
703	@handle My experience is that people use their own resources or borrow from friends & family. Most ideas seem stupid or iffy.
703	@handle I was referring to Urban Legend. Sorry if I confused you.
703	@handle Individuals might save less, but, if there are more of them & fewer people needing aid, couldn't the pie grow?
703	@handle I didn't understand how he got stuck with such low interest rates on his bonds when he's a long term buyer.
703	@handle It seems to me that buying stocks when they're low, & long term bonds when they're high is the answer.

3638	@handle If spacing effect is the same as spaced practice, it's well researched in the ed psych lit. See Clark & Mayer's books.
3638	@handle For research on informal learning, take a look at SRI International's Center for Technology in Learning
3638	What would happen if we designed curriculum for the teachers we actually have in math, rather than the ones we wish we had?

3638	Feldstein: does Google Wave mean the end of LMS? http://bit.ly/5uSBF. Misses the point: both are instructionally atheoretical. Depressing.
3638	Which comes first? Conceptual/declarative instruction, or procedural instruction? Education.ti.com/research will post a study in July

268	@handle I recall reading once that the X in Xmas is for the cross so it isn't actually sacreligious at all. I'll try to find it.
268	@handle Actually, harder than you know. Relies on a resistive bi-metallic contact. That's the clicking you hear as it makes & breaks.
268	Sometimes I regret making dirty jokes. Normally I'm the nicest guy you'll ever eat.
268	Mondays I visit the asphalt plants. I call it Hardhat Day. After Banana Hammock & Cowboy Boots Day, it's like my favorite day.
268	@handle I heard it was your birthday, hope it's a great one!
268	@handle No bullshit, that has actually happened to me. Not the do over part, though.
268	Trolling Twitter in order to RT people misusing the word literally? That is LITERALLY one of the doucheiest things I've ever heard.
268	@handle Yeah yeah, mom said I'd go blind too.
268	@handle Back to fondling the rest of you, then.
268	@handle You say that as if my raging monomania were some sort of, oh I don't know, problem.
268	@handle Oh no, I've tried drinking from that firehose before.
268	Someone DM when Favstar comes back. I'll be over here, sweating and shaking, trying not to puke.
268	What's the best way to whine about Favstar downtime w/o sounding like an ungrateful, narcissistic bitch? Asking for everyone.
268	@handle The pornbots are always watching. Allllllways watching.
268	@handle Hard to be certain. The face is partially obscured. Guessing huge cocks are the new hide my face with a coffee cup. meme.
268	Lady, if I can't put my fist in it, it's not large. And then Jack in the Box exercised their right to refuse service to me.

3708	@handle That's good to know. I've felt that Clooney was better than most of his movies.
3708	Maybe I'm not fashionable, but I like some science in my science-fiction. That goes for every SciFi show on the air right now.
3708	@handle Maybe they went too far with the review, but it was way too soapy for me. I like my drama to come from the present situation.
3708	@handle Ugh. Yuck.
3708	@handle LOL. You can send me the last draft to proof. Good luck and tell us when it's out.
3708	@handle Yes, a velvet blouse goes a long way this time of year.
3708	@handle It's strange. When Thanksgiving comes so late, it turns into Christmas at midnight.
3708	@handle Thanks. My sister and her husband cooked a great meal, then we played cards. We had a bad scare when my Mom fell, but she's OK.
3708	@handle I tried a mini cupcake. It was good, but they didn't have the interesting varieties that you've mentioned.

3708	@handle LOL. There is something very wrong about the idea of vampire themed bandages.
3708	@handle Oh my gosh, Shay. Look at you! I had no idea that you could go so far in such a short time. You are an inspiration.
3708	@handle I agree that Twitter is great for real-time reports, but no one can replace Walter Cronkite's reputation, voice and humanity..
3708	@handle It seems that the Mouse needs to learn some manners. No review show catches my interest now. It's all hype.
3708	Hi Sawitta. :-)
3708	Off to bed. It's a rainy night.'Good for sleeping. Good night all. Sweet dreams.
3708	What twists your brain into knots more than doing logic models? Oh yeah. Time travel paradoxes.

3708	Instead, I'm watching a documentary on Chris McCandless of Into the Wild. My theory? He was running away from something, but what? So sad.
3708	I'm behind on my workouts. I tore up the heel of my foot wearing some flats. I'm behind on my NaNo book, too. I must concentrate this week.
3708	@handle I didn't think Taken was awful. I thought it was scary and intense, but then I'm a girl. 'Different viewpoint.
3708	@handle Not bad, but the original was MUCH better. I thought Liam Neeson should have played Klatu.
3708	@handle Yeah. I wonder if his people knew. They will now.

2780	@handle Yes. I just DM'ed you back. LOL
2780	@handle Hi, Nicki.
2780	@handle LOL Not a problem. If you're not feeling well, you should get checked out by an m.d., but alcohol poisoning usually = unconscious.
2780	@handle If you're conscious, chances are you do NOT have alcohol poisoning. LOL
2780	@handle Aw, well, keep looking on YT then. Good stuff.
2780	@handle Also have a friend named LegaspiWeaver as in Kim/Kerry from ER. Very cool.
2780	@handle We also have some girl here named SpenRiv (Spencer/Rivera or Olivia/Natalia duh!!!!)
2780	@handle Well, the Nikki/Helen s/l was the best, but there were also the Cassie/Roisin, Kris/Selena, and Pat/Sheena s/l's. AWESOME!!!!
2780	@handle You should catch it on Logo sometime. It's awesome!!!!
2780	@handle Are you kidding me?LOL StewartWade can only mean one thing - Nikki/Helen. How much did you love that s/l?
2780	@handle Yeah, cool, huh? I LOVE Nikki and Helen. Was thrilled that they got a happy ending. You do watch Bad Girls, right?
2780	@handle Hi! Love your name. I take it you are a Helen/Nikki fan?
2780	@handle Ummm nope don't have that have that on right now, but may click over to see how it's going. I also like the Bears, too.

2780	@handle Yeah!!! Go Dolphins!!!
2780	@handle Sorry, clicked on the wrong name for that last tweet.

2780	@handle @handle Go Dolphins!!
2780	@handle OMG!!! How amazing is that??? Well, next time you speak to her, tell her your friend KG is a big fan!!! :-)
2780	@handle Mine Is Just Another Woman In Love. I know. I'm a romantic sap!!! LOL
2780	@handle AWESOME!!!! Thank you so much!!! I had no idea Anne Murray was on twitter. I love her!!! What's your fave song?
2780	@handle Aww, thank you. I appreciate that. Wait up! Anne Murray is on Twitter???!!! Hold the phone!!!!!!
2780	@handle LOL Thank you. No, she wasn't weird. It's just that we Yanks get so much turkey on Thanksgiving that not many want it again Friday
2780	@handle ROFL I'm not that lucky, mate! No, she just said that she never thought she'd have anyone order turkey the day after Thanksgiving
2780	@handle LOL Yeah, I've always loved Thanksgiving. Time with family, thinking about your blessings, and good food!!! Turkey is my favorite!
2780	@handle BTW, It won't always be on the 26th necessarily. It's the 4th Thursday in November. It just HAPPENS to be on the 26th this year.
2780	@handle No offense taken at all. We're happy to have you here. Hope you enjoy the holiday. :-) It's my favorite!! Good food!!!! LOL

7141	@handle I must make more ice and unpack my bar. And I would have stayed sober if it wasn't for those muddling kids!
7141	My very refreshing nap and weird dream were cut short by @handle's telephonic recap of her improv mixer scene with @handle
7141	@handle Not surprising, really. The Dems are great at eating their own. Mission 2010: Boot Stupak and bankrupt the Catholic Church.
7141	Got bratwurst f/lunch, finished Innumeracy, locked self out again, neighbor lent me butter knife to break back in, moved boxes, back in bed
7141	@handle I imagine when your worlds collide, there's a torrential downpour of Skittles!

7141	@handle ... and @handle would become cross if I said anything negative about Silent Cal, being from her beloved Northampton.
7141	@handle I totally forgot about Taft & Coolidge. IIRC Taft did well on the Supreme Ct. Hoover was better as an ex-pres, like Carter...
7141	@handle That was my Col. Kurtz impression. For my next act, I'll swallow a bug.
7141	@handle I wouldn't insult you in person because a) I usually agree with you and b) you know 1000 ways to set me on fire.
7141	@handle Please tell me there will be fire...
7141	@handle Yes indeedy, Teddy left to form the Bull Moose Party. Aside from TR & Ike, were there any noble R presidents in the 20th Cnt?
7141	SELL THE HOUSE. SELL THE CAR. SELL THE KIDS. I'M NOT COMING BACK.
7141	The aroma of cooked meat, the beer, the model train, and the old school Republican iconography - I feel I'm in heaven. Needs books, tho.
7141	@handle Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying Get well soon! #comfortablynumb
7141	@handle I should see if I can send you one of our sludge videos. Pretty weird lifting a 6 layer of kaolin with a bubble of air.
7141	@handle A rotational viscosimeter no less. If you have a copy of Transport Phenomena, there's a well-known exercise about one in there.
7141	@handle Spankypants are the savior of lady improvisors everywhere. Fan service should be intentional (and cost extra...) ;)
7141	I reiterate: I find the portrait of Teddy Roosevelt & photo of Lincoln heartwarming, reminding me of when Republicans had brains & virtue.
7141	@handle Now I need to read it again. Glad it worked out for you. I wish I could remember who gave me my copy.
7141	On TV: Nuggets vs Hawks. Missing linking word: Chicken.
7141	Skrine Chops in FP: beer, meat, taxidermy, O-gauge model train orbiting the bar, pictures of Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Johnny Cash. Comfy!
7141	@handle Huzzah! The finish line is within sight...
7141	@handle That means you get a free gun & bible (but lose your dental coverage.)
7141	Berfday wishes to the mighty Valroth & Uncle Sweaty! RT @handle: Happy birthday to Mike K.!
7141	@handle The was something green on my plate tonight. I think it was broccoli.
7141	Oh, ABC Family - what conflict *can't* be resolved with a dance-off?
7141	@handle You would not be surprised at how many times I get tripped up between ls & dir. Just show me the files, you arrogant box of sand.
7141	Today's word: viscosimeter. As in I forgot to price a rotational viscosimeter at work this week.
7141	Ugh. Just saw Charmin's animated tribute to dingleberries. The appalling tastelessness leaves me speechless. I was eating dinner, assholes.
7141	@handle Here's a game. Now find components. #SixWordGameStory #cheapass
7141	RT @handle It's currently 70 deg. and cloudless in Chicago. If you're reading this on a computer, turn it off and go outside. #perfectday
7141	@handle @handle I would like to lose 50#, 15yrs & go clubbing. @handle is no doubt appalled and cross.

7289	@handle She clawed your genitals and said she didn't love you anymore?
7289	@handle How did she make you cry?
7289	@handle Less problems? You have brought war to your doorstep.
7289	@handle But how would anyone know?
7289	@handle I saw her on a panel in Bouchercon. She didn't let anyone else talk.
7289	@handle He told me I could get on one of his tracks to promote the book. Also, I mean, it's Kanye West.
7289	@handle @handle I DID IT ON PURPOSE TO SEE IF YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION. I SWEAR.
7289	@handle Thanks professor!
7289	@handle Nah. Mine take 4-5 months and are readable in one night. Their short and snappy!
7289	Happy Thanksgiving everyone!
7289	@handle Hey that is an excellent, excellent point. Did I say bad for anything?
7289	@handle Poison in disguise. Poison that finds cracks in your defenses and snares you with its devil magic.
7289	@handle Thanks, I needed the slap. Females = bad for writing. Well, bad for anything, really.
7289	@handle As I've already learned. Broken of heart AND body. All that is left is my soul, and that is on the wane too.
7289	@handle Ooh. I like your description best. : )
7289	@handle A girl introduced me to Irish whisky. I can't figure out which one I love more. It's like scotch, but sweeter.
7289	@handle Did we finally figure out what genre I write?!
7289	@handle That is VERY cool. I wish I had other talents besides whiskying (yes, a verb) and writing gutter fiction.
7289	@handle You made that?
7289	@handle Oregon. I'm in your backyard, fighting your pet hawk. Call it off, Bill. Call the effing hawk off.

7289	You can't make this up. I had so many questions.
7289	Lady came in on her phone. It was so loud I could hear the person talking on the other end. They said, He wants to be stroked every day.

4267	@handle - http://youtube.com/chrisbrogan
4267	@handle - thanks. I get around, so maybe. :)
4267	@handle - either #droid, #pre, or #iphone. The only 3 worth it in smartphones. Okay, maybe BB Tour...
4267	@handle - thanks. Are you blogging about it?
4267	@handle - none yet.
4267	@handle - I'm using Swift and liking it. #droid.
4267	@handle - will check it out. Thanks!
4267	One point @handle is very right about re: #droid - the facebook app blows.
4267	@handle - iphone, and I still like it. Just frustrated by the network.
4267	@handle - not sure. Will try. :)

4267	@handle they never responded so I don't know.
4267	Gotta jump offline. Descending.
4267	.@handle - thanks, Becky. I tried hard. I appreciate your feedback. As my expert advisor since 2005 or so, thanks.
4267	@handle - that was our intent.
4267	@handle - well, that's the goal. Nothing super involved, but a place to hang our hat.
4267	@handle - and the cool thing? I have business cards that look like that. I have a background somewhere.. if @handle re-sends it.
4267	@handle - thank you so much. : )

4267	@handle - thanks, sir. I had the best designers and team do the work. I just had to write mushy copy. : )
4267	Sorry, but content is NOT king. You are - http://bit.ly/2Eh25W
4267	@handle - um.. swell SNAP. as in Photo. Sorry, was reading @handle tweet about plantains. Got hungry. : )

4267	@handle - that's a swell snack. : )
4267	@handle - to which? Droid? No. AT&T. Sick of dropped calls. Enticed by 10,000 open apps.

4267	@handle - what did you think? Letdown?
4267	@handle - I'm glad to participate. :)
4267	.@handle - it makes a Sharpie feel like a flowing pen of distinction. It's like nice pants. : )
4267	@handle - I love it. : )
4267	@handle - no you're great. I'm just here to start it.
4267	@handle - I try, Gwen. I'm aiming at giving you tools to slay dragons.
4267	@handle - I now have 3 (count 'em) stainless steel sharpies. I love them.
4267	@handle - how'd it work?
4267	@handle - hope we can say hi after. :)
4267	@handle - I try my best.

4267	Hey @handle - I'm not sure Seesmic is playing nicely with the new Adobe Air beta 2. Rendering issues.

4267	@handle - hey there! and hey @handle . Now this is neat. : )
4267	Saw a great preso by @handle where he talked about Google Wave and @handle 's thoughts, etc. I still don't get it. Just me?
4267	I think it's okay if @handle, @handle , @handle , and I work on some Saturday nights. #fortherecord
4267	@handle - SEO (that I don't know how to do) plus flexibility, plus strong bones for better designers to work on and theme.
4267	@handle - sorry, no. Design elements within thesis. There are 2 ways to do it: yourself or with a designer. I used B. : )
4267	Ooooh. Look at @handle 's blog in Thesis - http://bit.ly/12wDxN
4267	@handle - great question. The team.
4267	@handle - There are themes that are free. Thesis is not. It's a premium theme. themes.wordpress.net has many free ones.
4267	@handle - and I have tons of design friends to share.
4267	@handle - but if you want it to look custom, I'd say you want design themes.
4267	@handle - it looks good out of the box, and if you watch the video embedded in the post I linked to, you'll see some new design tips.
4267	Always happy to see new designs based on Thesis. Looking for a quality WordPress theme? - http://bit.ly/1k9SXg
4267	@handle - I'm really happy about that. I love Thesis. I think @handle has a great Wordpress Theme.
4267	@handle - it's an oldie so doesn't talk about social media as much.
4267	@handle - I do. We don't exactly have finger rolls together, but I've met him a bunch of times.

4267	(faster) Subscribe to chrisbrogan.com and get my Business Wish List for 2010 tonight- http://bit.ly/1uPOvu
4267	@handle - interesting and odd.
4267	@handle - yipes. I can't imagine.
4267	@handle - funny, I was thinking something similar.
4267	Just heard at my ice cream store: we don't have cones. They're coming in later. Um....
4267	@handle - if @handle had his way, GateJumpers would have been our next book. I stole the topic for something new. : )
4267	@handle - should, but doesn't. API-related problems.
4267	@handle - Sorry we didn't get the chance to chat at the event. Nice to stand near you briefly. : )
4267	@handle - I think it's been an interesting exercise so far.
4267	@handle - thanks. : )
4267	@handle - thanks. That's in my no-fly-zone, so probably won't be available, but if that changes, I'll ping you. : )
4267	Heard the link was broken. Get my blog tomorrow to hear my 2010 business wish list - http://bit.ly/60ZLgg
4267	@handle - mostly because I like @handle, but also, in the early days, it let me make lists by adding instead of trying to load things.
4267	@handle - that's just it. That's the issue, really. So far, my little town is little. I wouldn't want it getting microscopic.
4267	And no, @handle , I didn't try a backflip. I tried the Chevy Chase dance in Christmas Vacation.
4267	@handle - beats me. I think it was just one dude.
4267	@handle - not even close. But then, I change it.
4267	@handle - right. That's how I prove I'm not famous.
4267	Technically, not a feeling of celebrity. More like.. oh crap, do I need to move my office?
4267	@handle - I *love* Cider Hill Farm. I take the kids there.
4267	@handle - I said, I might be. Do I owe you money, or was I inappropriate?
4267	@handle - better than a Storm. Not sure about Tour or Storm 2.
4267	@handle - see if you can bid.
4267	@handle - pity. I like being funny. : )
4267	@handle - I still like @handle's line  massive multiplayer online photoshop.
4267	@handle - agreed. I think pooping on it is the bad move.
4267	Just got are you Chris Brogan? at my local coffeeshop. Now that's rare. : )
4267	@handle - I don't seem to talk on Twitter about funny things, I guess.
4267	@handle - my take - http://bit.ly/5k5wpr
4267	@handle - that paper stuff helps.
4267	@handle - I remember, but you're right.
4267	@handle - Evernote/Pixelpipe/Snaptell/Twidroid/and Maps.
4267	@handle - things I want in the doing business department. Project requests, etc.
4267	@handle - I don't think Droid is it, but I think it's close. My take - http://bit.ly/5k5wpr
4267	@handle - beats me. People often say I didn't realize you were funny when they meet me in person. Odd, eh?
4267	@handle - the Droid thing? Yeah. Silly, eh?
4267	I'm going to put together a business wish list for 2010. Why not?
4267	@handle - true. What was missing: web-to-real integration.
4267	@handle - I don't have stats on that.
4267	Oooh. Droid ad pooping on iPhone - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLDxv9ohH2s (youtube)
4267	@handle - oh, all I'm doing is collecting fringe blogs and books about education for adults. Learning some new models.
4267	@handle - that's my plan. : )
4267	@handle - makes sense
4267	@handle - huge. They'll push hard about monopoly so it'll take a while.
4267	@handle - was it ever alive?
4267	@handle - I used ScreenFlow for mac
4267	@handle - no, the brogan OR chrisbrogan column finds stuff that the Replies column misses (typos and stuff).
4267	GREAT post by @handle about the First Rule of Copyblogger - http://bit.ly/6vKS84
4267	@handle - embarrassed, but yes, I got it out this morning.
4267	Look over my shoulder at my view of Twitter- http://bit.ly/8LLT8v (youTube)
4267	@handle - hey thanks! : )
4267	@handle - beats me. Good question.
4267	@handle - I don't.
4267	@handle - I'm evidently big in Indonesia. : ) Hello to you. : )
4267	@handle - congrats and that's awesome. : )

4267	@handle - it's delicious. : )
4267	@handle - not a joke. A friend just tipped me off. Pretty funny/sad, eh?
4267	@handle - and he stole my rss widget, but it's counting MY subs. : )
4267	@handle - well thanks. : )
4267	@handle - do you think they equate?

4267	@handle - :)
4267	@handle - than Storm 1? Yes. Haven't tried the new Storm.
4267	Use and follow the tag #newbooks to be part of a cool discussion.
4267	@handle , @handle, @handle - gotta run. Thanks for the chat. My boy needs some attention. #newbooks #dadabouttown
4267	@handle - very cool. : )
4267	@handle - thanks. I do what I can. : )
4267	@handle - so can collaborators contribute on the way to learning, or only after someone learns and presents? #newbooks
4267	@handle - I appreciate the kind words. : )
4267	@handle - cool. So your books are sourced a bit via Twitter. #newbooks
4267	@handle - I think I'm a tribe leader for Trust Agents, and for #3rdTribe and other stuff. #newbooks
4267	@handle - def depends on the book. Trust Agents had only about 2000 people on the FB group. #newbooks.
4267	@handle - collaboration is often a mess because no one leads, and because no one keeps a guiding measure. #newbooks.
4267	Want a great list of visual thinking resources? From @handle - http://www.squidoo.com/davegray

4267	@handle - hope you enjoy it.
4267	@handle - re the author/reader comment earlier, I try hard to think of them as participants/collaborators.
4267	In my newsletter, I talked about drawing business. Here's a brief example (video) - http://bit.ly/5st2Bx
4267	@handle - we provide anonymized data and references.
4267	@handle - then I doubt you've worked in consulting. I put my client list on my site. You can ask any of them for details.
4267	@handle - what? That old thing? Hardly remembered. ;)
4267	@handle - what would be unfortunate would be betraying my clients' trust. I might solicit so case studies.
4267	@handle - always good to measure. I didn't include everything. Just a sampler.
4267	@handle - I prefer making revenue improve.
4267	@handle - not in most cases. Their engagements are private and theirs to expose.
4267	Need to better understand a social media marketing engagement? - http://bit.ly/5RwcwR
4267	@handle - now that's interesting.
4267	@handle - heh. I'm not really on there. I'm not smart enough to use it. : )
