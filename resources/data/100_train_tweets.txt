564	#treat is awesome, but #trick is more fun.
564	You can learn a lot about how people see you by how you're listed. For example, it seems that people feel strongly that I work at Twitter.
564	I'm not sure when I switched from reading books in bed just before going to sleep to checking email, but I don't think it's healthy.
564	Another headphones cable on the fritz. I need to buy these things in bulk.
564	@handle Get a magical parking card. http://bit.ly/zpKsH Available pre-tax through WageWorks.
564	Ok then. I'm just going to hold off for a little while and react to this later.
564	I'm beginning to think this day would have gone better if I had started it differently. Mainly if I'd skipped the getting out of bed part.
564	I just finished season one of The Tudors, and omg you guys--you'll never believe how it ends!
564	@handle Perhaps ideal for the undead.
564	It's a good thing I have this never-ending mountain of email to sort though. Otherwise waiting on these tests would be boh-rring.
564	I want there to be substantially less waiting in my day to day life.
564	Embroidery: cooler than you would think.
564	@handle called me a pretty little hate machine. It made me blush.
564	Don't cloud the wonder of this week with your little ...facts.
564	I block for misdirected @ replies.
564	@handle No. I would burn alive contentedly at my laptop without ever having heard the fire alarm.
564	Finally figured it out. There's only one escalator at this Bart station. It changes direction depending on the time of day.
564	I'm watching the shipping casualty of this move hasten to its doom from the tracking page. Poor little guy. He has no idea what he's in for.
564	@handle Wow. Just... wow.
564	Took a chance on some molasses clove cookies. Oh yeaaah, I live on the wild side. And it's tasty here.
564	@handle What timezone are you in? Because if being up at 11pm makes you an insomniac then... *pats your head*
564	@handle Yes, and then she loaned it to me. But I can assure you, we both knew what we were getting into.
564	Anyone who believes that you cannot judge a book by its cover has not seen the cover of this book: http://amzn.com/0373621353
564	The prospect of a new office on Monday fills me with the kind of hope that scares me. (That is, any.)
564	Just remembered my stressful dream. I sure hope @handle isn't mad at me still.
564	@handle Well, hello fellow moocher. Thanks for getting to it so quickly!
564	Today in cute: Cinder eats with his hands. Scoops up each piece of kibble with his paw and head tilted, daintily dishes it into his mouth.
564	Nothing will make you realize just how dumb something is as trying to explain it to someone else.
564	The one thing that USPS has on UPS, FedEx and all other carriers: the forwarding address.
564	We sincerely appreciate your feedback. But please note, there is a 250 character limit. Max exceeded. Turns out I only needed four.
564	I'm going to be a full hour late to this thing. My only excuse? C'mon, it's Saturday.
564	Donated to a public artistic preformance for the first time in years. It was both striking and silent.
564	Thinking warm, congratulatory thoughts towards the people who made that thing happen. You know who you are.
564	@handle Never Forget.
564	Abandoned cat is abandoned. http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/pet/1451640811.html Please adopt or RT.
564	Alright, that's it. Today calls for cookies.
564	I need something to cheer me up from my somber contemplation. Oh, this economics book will do quite nicely. What? Dismal is realtive.
564	Wanted: a lightweight, fast, simple note taking web app that stores to the cloud and is on iphone. Note: omnifocus does not qualify AT ALL.
564	@handle That is exactly as it should be.
564	Whatever. It'll be like paypal. We'll just hire lots of laywers.
564	What ever happened to smelling salts anyway? Oh. Ammonia gas is toxic in large concentrations for prolonged periods, and can be fatal...
564	GENIUS money making idea: An alarm clock that involves smelling salts.
564	Alright you guys, I let you have your fun. But it's November--it's time to put the sun away now.
564	@handle I don't get the hate people have for Nickelback. Sure, they're poppy and derivative--but since when does that inspire such rage?
564	@handle Critical mass represents almost, but not quite everything that I hate about San Francisco.
564	@handle I get that all the time. I block the misguided souls so they no longer appear in my timeline. (Their updates, not their souls.)
3039	@handle Not a cool joke! I got pretty pissed for a split second! :)
3039	WOW! This morning has been a roller coaster! But I'm in such a great mood :D

3039	:D! @handle RT @handle: @handle wow, uli is the luckiest man on earth. :)
3039	@handle You know, punching bags do punch back :) Hope your day gets better.
3039	@handle Some things just aren't meant to mix... and other are :D Like football and sex :D
3039	@handle It's got everything you need: football and sex :D
3039	@handle Thanks! :D If you need an extra body at your practices, let me know :) Just throwing it out there ;)
3039	@handle Hahaha! Thanks! Def look into it. It's tough, not your typical girlie league.
3039	@handle Couldn't make it, but I tried out last year and want to try out again. :)
3039	@handle Not at all :) I'm all for it!
3039	@handle That's interesting! It's all about relevance.
3039	@handle That would not be fun at all! Do you not like it?
3039	@handle Hell yea! I'm all pumped up now and want to go play!
3039	@handle What what?
3039	@handle Ohhhh. How'd it go? What did you discuss?
3039	A quick convo about the Lingerie Football League and I want to go hit a tackling dummy! Grrrrr!

3039	@handle I'm glad you didn't try to find out for yourself :)
3039	@handle Which lyric? My fave of his is I'm not a businessman. I'm a business, man. :D
3039	Someone just told me it's Wednesday. I almost slapped them! Don't mess w/ my days of the week! My dad and bro come in tomorrow!

3887	With brand experience must understand not only what we need to start doing but also what we should stop doing #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	A well defined & executed brand strategy will yield quantifiable results - volume, mkt leverage.... #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	ROI? Brand performance is about growth in revenue, profit, mkt share, loyalty. #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Best brand portrayals are emotional & focus on benefits, not features per Joel English. #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Brand building is a journey and requires a long term committment and a well defined process to drive success. #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Brand Mastery: Want engaged consumers? Understand that a brand is not a campaign; brand is who we are and what we do #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Brand Mastery: Is your brand value proposition hard-wired into the culture of the organization? Powerful brands do this. #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Must have a brand-driven culture that transforms an org into one that delivers on the brand rather than just promotes. #shsmd #hcmktg
3887	Brand Mastery: Have to be aware of brand barriers in crafting strategy. Your brand has to be relevant and believable. #shsmd #hcmktg

3887	Brand Mastery session: Rob Klien - @handle - good mkt research reduces the risk in decision making #shsmd

8129	In contrast to this lilting sound, its substance was denser, like a blind child giving you explicit directions in darkness.
2771	Uhoh - Steve McNanaman sighting!!!
2771	@handle - me too. That was real emotion from AI.
2771	@handle - Instead of handing other packages, perhaps the lady @ the FedEx counter would like to handle your package. Just a thought...
2771	Watching the World Cup draw. Curious to see who's in the Group Of Death.
2771	@handle - South Africa is a sleeper pick. Steven Pienaar is quality and their GK, Itumeleng Khune is real good. Watch for them.
2771	Listening to DeBarge's Greatest Hits. Not El DeBarge -- just Debarge....the whole crew. Serious tunes !
2771	New tunes tonight in DC!!!
2771	@handle - Timbaland knows what he's doing. 1000%.
2771	@handle - on the site now. that tune with Nelly Furtado is HEAVY!
2771	@handle - good point on the $$ thing.
2771	@handle - worse than Whole Foods?
2771	AI press conference, very emotional. #3 belongs in Philly. The AI story will end the way it should.
2771	@handle - finally. a journalist with common sense.
2771	Wookie - Battle. Never gets old. EVER. -> http://bit.ly/XUgwe
2771	@handle - congrats on the new gig! You've got something important to say and radio is the way to do it.
2771	RT @handle: RT @handle: Latest Dub War Podcast is up mixed by Badawi: http://bit.ly/5xb5yw
2771	@handle - Ian Eagle is good, but he's no Gus Johnson...
2771	@handle - you know it bro. this is Baltimore. Life imitating art and vice versa. \
2771	Eto'o is top class, but Ibrahimovic is next level. He has World Footballer Of The Year talent. I don't see the same in Eto'o.
2771	@handle - looking forward to the read. thanks...
2771	@handle - can you link us to the column please?
2771	@handle - barca 1 - xerez 0. three more to go...
2771	@handle - true. that's a lot of talent on the bench. I don't have 1/2time Hennessey. Just Gatorade.
2771	@handle - yeah, those are pink grapefruit kits. not sexy at all. Hi-Liter pink.
2771	@handle - i was thinking tangerine....but grapefruit works.
2771	Barca v Xerez on ESPN2 right now. Barca should win this match by 4 goals. Xerez is bottom of the table in LaLiga. Barca is # 1. We'll see.
2771	@handle - I finally finished the book. An enjoyable and educational read. The epilogue...amazing. THANK YOU.
2771	@handle - likewise! We're both operating from what we know. Curious to get your take on this.
2771	@handle - The break in Lyn Collins - Think, Baltimore club staple. That break was used in dnb, but not nearly as much in bmore club.
2771	@handle - The answer, bmore. I don't know much about dnb, but i do know The Winstons - 'Amen Brother' is the backbone for dnb & jungle.
2771	@handle - (For those that are wondering) Lyn Collins - Think: -> http://bit.ly/6eiICa
2771	@handle - well done.
2771	Sylvia Striplin - You Can't Turn Me Away. Give it a listen...you know the sample. http://bit.ly/6q5IJt

1121	RT @handle: No disrespect to @handle, but I'm Sounders Till I Die! Vote @handle in TPL: http://ow.ly/v7V4 #TPL
1121	The stars were aligned last night for Seattle. Today, not so much for the Seahawks. We should find a way to remedy this...
1121	So what does everyone think??? Who is going to get the game winner tonight in the Sounders Kansas City game??? I'll take Jaqua...
1121	Why does it bother me so much in emails when people use to/two/too incorrectly? Does that make me a huge nerd? If so, I am ok with it....
1121	Weeding and fertilizing my lawn before the US match. I should hire a rookie to do this...
1121	Speedy recovery to Charlie... can't wait to see your 9th min tribute. And good luck to the US Men...
1121	This is what injured players do when the team is away... http://bit.ly/13LJwt
1121	Back to training after the weekend off. Got to train almost all-in for the first time in 6 weeks. So fun. Still excited about the US Nats!
1121	VOTE FOR ME: http://ow.ly/tWap RT @handle: Twitterverse Players League - Group H: @handle @handle @handle @handle #TPL
1121	Weekend off for the team. Allows us to focus on the Honduras match tomorrow. I can already smell South Africa (in a good way)...
1121	Hosted 'Cribs' at the Starfire facilities today. Keep your eye out for it online. Wait till you see what I planted in a couple lockers!

1121	Yoga and physical therapy this morning.. All you can eat sushi lunch with Roger, now brainstorming for a roaring 20's outfit. Suggestions?
1121	I think tetherball is one of the more underrated sports. Should it only be played during 4th grade recess??? I think not...
1121	Roger, aka the homeless man from Seattle, shines as the hero! So happy for the boys. A la Black Eyed Peas, tonight's gonna be a good night!
1121	Team away to Columbus, injured guys holding down the fort here in Seattle. Despite my effort, the stationary bike will not move....

1121	Visited Puesta del Sol School today in Factoria and spoke to the 2nd and 5th grades. Spanish Language Schools are pretty amazing!!!
1121	Tough weekend for Seattle Sports... Sounders, Seahawks! At least Stanford got a victory over UW... sorry Huskies.
1121	Two things I hate about yesterday's game. Losing, and seeing players get injured. I hope Ralston's knee is not that bad.
1121	TGIF... one more day till another big game. Might as well be in the playoffs already.

9148	@handle -- To answer your D/ST question, you really can't lose with either NO or BALT ... both are playing HORRIBLE TEAMS (go w/ Ravens)
9148	@handle -- Titans rookie WR Kenny Britt may be a great Gage replacement -- and a better alternative to T.O. at this point ...
9148	@handle -- No worries. Those 3 rants were not intended for anyone in particular ... I just hate defensive questions, in general ...
9148	@handle -- I would not drop Donald Brown for ANY Redskin right now ... unless you REALLY A NEED a 4th-string WR, hold on to D-Brown
9148	Here are today's Thursday Revelations/Fantasy Clicks ... enjoy! http://tinyurl.com/yj4cqwe
9148	@handle -- Change of plans: Justin Gage has multiple broken bones in his back ... you might wanna NOT pick him up for the time being ...
9148	@handle -- Then go Brady over Peyton ...
9148	@handle -- I'd rank your WRs 1)Austin 2)Jennings 3)Holmes 4)Boldin for Week 10 ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Do you actually have Peyton AND Brady? If so, does it really matter?
9148	@handle -- Celek over V-Davis (barely) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd rather have LT/Crabtree over D-Jax, if that's what you're asking ... (but it's very, very close)
9148	@handle -- If you REALLY want AP, you'll have to surrender 1 Tier 1 RB/1 Tier 1 WR/1 Tier 2 RB/WR ... it's got to be a 3-for-1
9148	@handle -- You ride Ronnie and Forte in Week 10 ... unless you know for sure Westbrook won't play (and we don't know that as of Thursday)
9148	@handle -- I'd start Dustin Keller over Heap in Week 10 ... in fact, I have that exact same scenario in one of my 10 leagues ... thx!
9148	@handle -- If T.O. is the worst WR on your roster, then dump him for Gage ... and I'd drop Felix's balky knee over Choice to get Betts
9148	@handle -- I shouldn't be disrespecting Cedric -- who's been amazing this year -- but I think Mendenhall has a better game in Week 10
9148	@handle -- For your two flex spots, let's ride Welker and SidRice over Witten, V-Davis, M-Barber and Reggie Bush .. thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd start Calvin over Boldin in Week 10 ...
9148	@handle -- WITHOUT knowing who's on your team or which twosome you'd be getting ... I'd rather have AP/Palmer over Peyton/K-Smith, thx!
9148	@handle -- Your should I dump Calvin is wayyyy too vague ... who else ya got? Me personally, I am going to ride him every week ...
9148	@handle -- OH, HOW I LOVE ANSWERING DEFENSIVE QUESTIONS ... WHAT FUN!!!! Sarcasm aside, Bengals long-term ... Fins this week!
9148	For those who haven't read today's Clicks ... I cover rankings for QBs/RBs/WRs/TEs ... http://tinyurl.com/yldfr34
9148	@handle -- Use your RB depth to make trades ... slaton to moats' owner ... mccoy to westbrook's ... sell Portis/ & Betts ... BE CREATIVE!
9148	@handle -- Part 1 -- I'd start Romo over Cutler (barely) ... Part 2 -- Yes, drop Knox for Greene ...
9148	@handle -- V-Davis ... http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/fantasy/11/11/wednesday.clicks/index.html
9148	Here are today's Fantasy Clicks -- literally HOT OFF THE PRESSES!!!! http://tinyurl.com/yldfr34
9148	@handle -- Eh, I'd probably want the Palmer/Jennings end -- but it's close!
9148	@handle -- I just sent 'em to New York ... which means they'll probably be on the site by 3 p.m. ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Once again, I'm not a big fan of vague questions ... what are your other options, should you choose to dump Portis?
9148	@handle -- I would rather have Mendenhall/Bowe over Carolina's Steve Smith/P-Thomas ... due to the Chiefs' easy-cheesy sked coming up
9148	@handle -- Yes, I would definitely surrender Palmer for Addai -- in a nanosecond! ... as for your RBs, start Peterson and Beanie ...
9148	@handle -- With your current roster, I would most certainly give up P-Rivers to get back CedBenson/Carson in return ... boom!
9148	@handle -- I'd rank your RBs like this for Week 10 -- 1)J-Stew 2)Hightower 3)Fargas 4)F-Jackson ... thx!
9148	@handle -- It's not a blowout ... but I'd rather have Fitz/Felix over Wayne/Reggie Bush in a standard-scoring league ... PPR? maybe not
9148	@handle -- Dude, did you seriously ask if you should dump an extra kicker for darren sproles? I oughta ban you from here for asking that
9148	@handle -- For Gates/Flacco in a keeper ... you'd probably get someone like ryan grant, p-thomas, mendenhall, knowshone, LT, barber, etc.
9148	@handle -- That question is too broad ... I need specifics to your personal situation...
9148	@handle -- I will NEVER pass up a chance to improve my team before the deadline (no exceptions) ... but I could be happy with your RBs ..
9148	@handle -- Uh, Fitz and the Cards have the easiest playoff-sked BY A COUNTRY MILE ... l'd side with Larry ...
9148	@handle -- That's rather vague ... do I like him as a No. 4 RB? yes ... a No. 2? no ... would I kill myself to trade for him? Uh, no ...
9148	Here are the fantasyland Week 11 Revelations -- hot off the presses! (will re-post later for non-early risers) ... http://twurl.nl/a0o037
9148	@handle -- You are very welcome ... I appreciate the patronage!
9148	@handle -- Not eve Maroney or Slaton family members would pick their kin over Ray Rice and T-Jones in Week 11. ... there's your answer
9148	@handle -- If you want to go safe at the flex, go with 1)Charles 2)Burleson 3)Chambers ... if it's feast-or-famine, let's ride D-Mac ..
9148	@handle -- Looks to me like you've ALREADY decided to take that trade ... but yes, I'd rather have Ocho/Beanie over Addai/Cribbs
9148	@handle -- Boldin, Rice and Calvin ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'm not thinking of Week 12, my man ... we'll address later
9148	@handle -- This is wayyyyyyyyyy too vague a question, my man ... should he be starting for you, that's all that matters????
9148	@handle -- As for your WRS ... let's ride Driver and Steve Smith ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Honestly, I think I'd rather take my chances on Devery Henderson ... but if I had to choose, I would probably go B-Marsh ...
9148	@handle -- Ummmm, I'd go with Sims-Walker over Hightower for your PPR in Week 11 ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd go Beanie over Lynch/LJ at RB ... at WR, let's ride Boldin & V-Jax over T.O., Braylon, Walter ... and thx for the patronage!
9148	@handle -- I have lost complete confidence in Lynch (so much that F-Jax is probably better ... but in your case, let's ride McCoy/MB3
9148	@handle -- It' s your lineup and your money. Ride that hunch!
9148	@handle -- If you absolutely, positively need a home run at the flex for Week 11 ... let's ride Devery over M-Bush, Fargas, Felix, Bryant
9148	@handle -- Oh goody, a defense question ... woo-hoo!!!! I'm taking the Saints, simply because NO has the more opportunistic D ...
9148	@handle -- SInce you had no follow-up questions from before, I will assume you liked Friday's Clicks ... thx for the patronage, as always!
9148	@handle -- Wow! When push comes to shove, I'm always starting Rodgers @ home (in good weather) ... and let's ride Austin at the WR slot
9148	@handle -- Shouldn't you be asleep by now? GameDay starts in, what, 6 hours!!! Damn!
9148	@handle -- For Week 11, I'd rank your flex RBs like this: 1)McCoy 2)F-Jax 3)Betts 4)Forsett ... although it's razor-thin between all 4 ...
9148	@handle -- I would rank 'em in the exact order you wrote: 1)Mendenhall 2) SidRice 3)Jacobs 4)Steve Smith (NYG) and 5)B-Scott for Week 11
9148	@handle -- First of all, you can't go wrong either way ... both are locks for 275 yards and/or 3 TDs ... but I'd play Warner over Brady!
9148	@handle -- For your PPR, I'd rank your Week 11 WRs like this: 1)Moss 2)Rice 3)Housh 4)Holmes 5)Burleson ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd rather have Hasselbeck over Palmer (barely) ... either one would be an upgrade though
9148	@handle -- I've been condemning Flacco for a while ... given the Ravens' Rice-reliance and the upcoming slate of cold-weather games
9148	@handle -- What? Are you saying that you ask the same question to 4-5 different experts every week? Sacre bleu! (Seriously ... thx!)
9148	@handle -- For your flex option, I'd go 1)McCoy 2)Betts 3)F-Jax 4)Forsett ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Maroney vs. T-Jones ... really? REALLY? What's with all the T-Jones hatred?
9148	@handle -- OOO, tempting ... but I think I'd rather go the S-Jax route ...
9148	@handle -- I'd rank your Week 11 RBs like this: 1)Moreno 2)Grant 3)Forsett
9148	@handle -- I'm just telling you how I would do it ... Crabtree's breakout is imminent ... and he's a low-risk play against Walter
9148	@handle -- No matter the situation, I'm riding T-Jones and P-Thomas in Week 11 (over Bernard Freaking Scott) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I don't do the weekly projections (I have enough on my plate) ... but I would rather have Breaston over Santana in Week 11
9148	@handle -- This is pretty easy, actually ... let's ride Crabtree and Burleson (who LOVES playing his old team) over Olsen & Walter
9148	@handle -- Thanks, I have enough TVs ...
9148	@handle -- Yes, I think I would gladly take S-Jax for B-Marsh and LT in a PPR league -- especially if Orton is out for 1-3 weeks ...
9148	@handle -- I'd go J-Maclin over your three TEs for Week 11 ... and yes, the Friday Clicks are already out ... thx!
9148	@handle -- During crunch time, I'm going to ride Addai over the Cincy backs ... just pray for 40 receiving yards and a goal-line TD ...
9148	@handle -- I think I'd choose Slaton over Betts in Week 11 (misspelled your Twitter ID the first time -- sorry)
9148	@handle -- I think I'd choose Slaton over Betts in Week 11 .. thx!
9148	@handle -- Have I not mentioned you before? OK, I'll get to you on Wednesday -- PROVIDED you send me a Week 12 lineup question ...
9148	Here are Friday's Fantasy Clicks/Thursday Revelations ... hot off the presses! http://tinyurl.com/ylbnacu
9148	@handle -- Test my skill? Test my skill? 1)Knowshon 2)Grant 3)Caddy ... BOOM!
9148	@handle -- I would want Peyton/AP over McNabb/C-Johnson ... perhaps one of the best last-minute blockbusters you'll ever see ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd go Jacobs over Bernard Scott ... and Breaston over Lee Evans in Week 11 (although I love Evans vs. JAX, too) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I answered the Beanie/Hightower/Slaton question in today's Clicks (to be published shortly on SI.com) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I think I'd prefer the Calvin/J-Stew side, compared to the Sidney Rice (and whatever you'd find on waivers) duo ... thx!
9148	@handle -- MSW is AVERAGING 6 catches/113 yards/1 TD in home games this year ... I think the choice is clear ... especially against Walter
9148	@handle -- I understand your Barber devotion ... but I'm always going to ride the hot hand (R-Bush -- 5 TDs in 5 games) during crunch time!!
9148	@handle -- If it's a PPR league, ride Housh ... and if it's a standard-scoring one, hmmmmm ... I think I would go Jacobs (by a nose), thx!
9148	@handle -- My Fantasy Clicks come out every M/W/F ... and I do a REVIEW of each 'League' episode every Wednesday ...
9148	@handle -- I'm just telling you what I'd do ... you're under no obligation to follow the advice ...
